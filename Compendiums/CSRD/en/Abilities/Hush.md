You create a transparent bubble within short range that muffles very loud sounds within it, such as alarms, sirens, leaf blowers, and crying babies. The bubble is about 3 feet (1 m) across and any noise from within it comes out no louder than a normal speaking voice. The bubble lasts for one minute and moves with the target. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the duration; one level of Effort increases the duration to ten minutes, two levels increases it to an hour, and three levels increases it to ten hours. Action.
