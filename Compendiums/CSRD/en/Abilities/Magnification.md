## Magnification
>**Action**  
>1 Intellect point

You create a rectangular frame, visible only to you, that doubles the magnification of whatever you see through it. The frame defaults to hovering in front of your face about an arm’s length away, but you can use your action to move it up, down, or to either side. The frame lasts for ten minutes and grants an asset on perception tasks at range. For each level of Effort you apply to this ability, you can increase the magnification by another increment (×3 for one level of Effort, ×4 for two levels of Effort, and so on). Action.
