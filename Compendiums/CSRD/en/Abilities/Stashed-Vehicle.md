## Stashed Vehicle  
>**Action**
  
You track down where you or a fellow prepper stashed a vehicle, pristinely stored to remain in working order with minimal repairs required. The vehicle has a viable power source (such as hundreds of gallons of gasoline treated to resist decomposition, or a rechargeable battery with options for solar or wind recharging). The vehicle could be an all-terrain vehicle (ATV), a truck, or something else; work with your GM to figure out the particulars. Enabler
