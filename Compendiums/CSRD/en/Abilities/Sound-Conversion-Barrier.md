## Sound Conversion Barrier    
>**Enabler**  
    
Attacks that hit you-especially energy attacks like focused light, heat, radiation, and transdimensional energy-are partially converted to surges of harmless noise similar to the sound of a wave crashing to shore. This ability grants you +1 Armor against all attacks and an additional +2 Armor against energy attacks. Enabler.
