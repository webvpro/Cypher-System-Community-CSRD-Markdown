# Fast Talk

**Cost**: 1 Intellect point
**Type**: Action

When speaking with an intelligent creature who can understand you and isnâ€™t hostile, you convince that creature to take one reasonable action in the next round. A reasonable action must be agreed upon by the GM; it should not put the creature or its allies in obvious danger or be wildly out of character. Action.
