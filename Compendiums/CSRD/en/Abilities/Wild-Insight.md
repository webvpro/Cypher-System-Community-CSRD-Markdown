## Wild Insight  
You gain a momentary perfect understanding of the flow of magic around you at this moment. When preparing your magic, choose one specific subtle cypher and make a magical lore skill roll against level 6. If you succeed, you gain that subtle cypher (the cypher's level is 6); if you fail, you get a random subtle cypher. If you aren't sure what specific subtle cypher you want, you can ask for a broad category such as "healing," "movement," or "skill"; this eases the magical lore task, and if you succeed, the GM chooses a random cypher that fits that category. You can't use this ability again until after you've taken a ten-hour recovery action. Enabler.
