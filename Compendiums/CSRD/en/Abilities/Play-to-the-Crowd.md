## Play to the Crowd  
>**Action**  
>3 Intellect points
  
You give a speech that is both rousing and terrifying. Those within short range who can hear and understand you have their next action either eased (an asset) or hindered-you choose, and it can be different for each individual. Action; a few rounds to complete.
