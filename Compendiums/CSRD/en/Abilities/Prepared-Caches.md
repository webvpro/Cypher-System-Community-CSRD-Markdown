## Prepared Caches  
>**Action**
  
You have a prepped secret hideout with shelter and basic supplies capable of seeing you through a year or more, or up to six people through about three months. In addition, you have knowledge of three different secret supply caches you put together and hid before everything fell apart, chosen from the following. The caches are located no closer than about 5 miles (8 km) from each other.* Food cache (enough food for six people for twelve weeks) * Water cache (enough clean water for six people for twelve weeks) * Ammunition cache (400 shells or bullets for four different weapons) * Firearm cache (six firearms; a mix of light, medium, and heavy weapons, each usually found with about ten bullets or shells)
