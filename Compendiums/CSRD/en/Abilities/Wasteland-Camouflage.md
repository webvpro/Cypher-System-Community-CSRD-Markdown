## Wasteland Camouflage  
>**Action**  
>5+ Speed or Intellect points
  
By drawing your clothing about you just so and using various tricks and your deep knowledge of your surroundings, you become invisible for ten minutes in any landscape that contains ruins of the before-times. (You may also attempt this in a purely wilderness setting, but if you do, you must spend 1 additional point from Speed or Intellect, whichever Pool you activated this power with.) While you are invisible, this asset eases your stealth and Speed defense tasks by two steps. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or position--attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding your position. Action to initiate or reinitiate.
