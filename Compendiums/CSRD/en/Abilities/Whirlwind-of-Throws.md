## Whirlwind of Throws    
>**Action**    
>5 Speed points  
    
With a large handful of small objects-tiny knives, shuriken, stones, jagged bits of metal, coins, or whatever is on hand-you attack every creature in an immediate area within short range. You must make attack rolls against each target. Each attack is hindered. You inflict 3 points of damage on targets you hit. Action.
