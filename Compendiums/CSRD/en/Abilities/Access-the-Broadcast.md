## Access the Broadcast
>**Action**  
>2+ Intellect point

You create a flat rectangular illusory “screen” within immediate range that can display any broadcast television signal in your area (similar to using a television with an antenna) or any video streams in the area (similar to tapping into a wireless network). The screen is anywhere from 1 to 3 feet (30 cm to 1 m) across, includes stereo sound, and lasts for one hour. As an action, you can change the channel, the volume, or both. The effect ends if you are more than a short distance away from the screen. For each level of Effort you apply to this ability, you can increase the width of the screen by up to 3 feet (1 m). Action.

>Wireless networks hosting video streams are usually locked or encrypted, which requires you to succeed on an Intellect-based attack roll against the network’s level (typically level 4) to watch them.
