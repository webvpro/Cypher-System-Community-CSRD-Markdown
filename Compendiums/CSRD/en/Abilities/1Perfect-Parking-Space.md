## 1Perfect Parking Space
  
>**Action**  
  
>3+ Intellect points
  
You can send your car into a pocket dimension that moves with you and is just large enough to hold it. Nobody other than you can perceive or access this space unless they have the ability to interact with transdimensional areas. The space is a part of you, so you can’t use it to store the car if you and the car have more cyphers than your limit, a detonation cypher activated inside the car while it’s in the space harms you, and so on. Storing or retrieving the car happens over one minute as it slowly (and visibly) vanishes or reappears; you can reduce this time to just one round if you succeed at a level 4 Intellect task. Action to initiate.
