## Incredible Feat of Science    
>**Action**    
>12 Intellect points  
    
You do something amazing in the lab. This takes parts and materials equivalent to three expensive items. Possible incredible feats include: Reanimate and command a dead body for one hour. Create an engine that runs on perpetual motion. Create a teleportation gate that remains open for one minute. Transmute one substance into another substance. Cure one person with an incurable disease or condition. Create a weapon designed to hurt something that can't otherwise be hurt. Create a defense designed to protect against something that can't otherwise be stopped. Action to initiate; a full day of work to complete.
