## Illusory Selves  
>ACTION 4  Intellect  
  
You create four holographic duplicates of yourself within short range. The duplicates last for one minute. You mentally direct their actions, and the duplicates aren't mirror images-each one can do different things. If struck violently, they either disappear permanently or freeze motionless (your choice). Action to create.
