## Medium Teleportation  
>**Action**  
>5+ Intellect points
  
You instantly teleport yourself to any location within a long distance that you can see. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase your range, teleport to a location you can't see, or bring other people with you. Each additional long distance costs one level of Effort. Teleporting to a destination you can't see costs one level of Effort. Each additional one or two targets brought with you costs one level of Effort (you must touch any additional targets). These levels of Effort are counted separately, so teleporting an additional long distance away to a location you can't see with two passengers costs a total of three levels of Effort. Action. If you already have Short Teleportation when you select Medium Teleportation or Teleportation, you may replace Short Teleportation with another tier 4 type ability.
