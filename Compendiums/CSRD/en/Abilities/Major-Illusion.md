## Major Illusion  
>ACTION 3  Intellect  
  
You create a complex scene of images within immediate range. The entire scene must fit within a100-foot (30 m) cube. The images can move, but they can't leave the area defined by the cube. The illusion includes sound and smell. It lasts for ten minutes and changes as you direct (no concentration is needed). If you move beyond immediate range of the cube, the illusion vanishes. Action to create.
