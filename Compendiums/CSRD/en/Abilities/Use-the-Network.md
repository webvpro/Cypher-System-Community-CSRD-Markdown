## Use the Network  
>**Action**  
>5 Intellect points
  
With a few minutes of looking around and preparing, you can access remnants of the before-times internet and satellite network (or an active network on which AIs who are not immediately dangerous reside). The GM may decide there is no such connection in the area, but if there is, you can ask one basic question about anything happening within 10 miles (16 km) and receive a simple answer. For example, you could ask about the location of a specific creature or individual, and if they are within the range of this ability, you'll learn about it from a still-functioning camera feed, satellite feed, or AI interaction. Action to initiate.
