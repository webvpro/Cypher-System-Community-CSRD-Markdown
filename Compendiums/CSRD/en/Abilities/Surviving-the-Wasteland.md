## Surviving the Wasteland  
>**Enabler**
  
Given about half a day of walking and scavenging, you find enough edible food and potable water in the ruins or surrounding wasteland for you and up to one other person for one day. The resources might be scavenged from before-times supplies, living flora and fauna, and uncontaminated water sources. Enabler.
