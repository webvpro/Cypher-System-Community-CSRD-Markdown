## Summon Demon  
>7  Intellect  
  
A demon appears within immediate range. If you applied a level of Effort as part of the summoning, the demon is amenable to your instructions; otherwise, it acts according to its nature. Regardless, the demon persists for up to one minute before it fades away-you hope. Action to initiate.
