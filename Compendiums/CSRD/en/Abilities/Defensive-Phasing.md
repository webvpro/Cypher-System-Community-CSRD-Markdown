## Defensive Phasing    
>**Action**    
>2 Intellect points  
    
You can change your phase so that some attacks pass through you harmlessly. For the next ten minutes, you gain an asset to your Speed defense tasks, but during this time you lose any benefit from armor you wear. Action to initiate.
