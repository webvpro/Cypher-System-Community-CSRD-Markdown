## Magical App Hacker    
>**Enabler**  
    
All magical app cyphers you use function at one level higher than normal. If given a week, you can tinker with one of your magical app cyphers, transforming it into another magical app cypher of the same type that you had in the past. The GM and player should collaborate to ensure that the transformation is logical for example, a magical app that creates a fiery explosion probably canâ€™t be turned into a healing app. Enabler.
