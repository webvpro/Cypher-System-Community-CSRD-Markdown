## Zero Dark Eyes    
>**Enabler**  
    
Some people's eyes are degraded by constantly playing games. And maybe that'll happen to you, but not yet. You're still young and instead of degrading, your vision is actually better thanks to all your practice. You can see in very dim light as though it were bright light. You can see in total darkness as if it were very dim light. Enabler.
