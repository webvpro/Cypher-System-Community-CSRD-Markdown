## Wrest From Chance    
>**Enabler**  
    
If you roll a natural 1 on a d20, you can reroll the die. If you reroll, you avoid a GM intrusion-unless you roll a second 1-and might succeed on your task. Once you use this ability, it is not available again until after you make a ten-hour recovery roll. Enabler.
