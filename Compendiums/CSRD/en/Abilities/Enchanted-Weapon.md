## Enchanted Weapon    
>**Action**    
>1 Intellect point  
    
You attune yourself to a physical weapon, such as a sword, hammer, or bow. You know exactly where it is if it is within a short distance of you, and you know its general direction and distance if farther away. All of your other focus abilities require you to be holding or wielding this weapon. You can be attuned to only one weapon at a time; attuning yourself to a second weapon loses the attunement to the first one. Action to initiate, ten minutes to complete. Enabler. 	If you attune yourself to a different weapon, come up with a story reason for why you are able to do that and why you chose this new weapon.
