## Blessing of the Gods  

As a servant of the gods, you can call up blessings in their name. This blessing depends on the godâ€™s general demeanor and area of influence. Choose two of the abilities described below.

### Authority/Law/Peace
>3 Intellect, Action
You prevent a foe that can hear and understand you from attacking anyone or anything for one round.  

### Benevolence/Righteousness/Spirit
 >2 Intellect, Action 
One level 1 demon, spirit, or similar creature within short range is destroyed or banished. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to destroy or banish a level 5 target (four levels above the normal limit), you must apply four levels of Effort.

### Death/Darkness  
>2 Intellect, Action  
>A target you choose within short range withers, suffering 3 points of damage.

### Desire/Love/Health
> 3 Intellect,  Action  
With a touch, you restore 1d6 points to one stat Pool of any creature, including yourself. This ability is a difficulty 2 Intellect task. Each time you attempt to heal the same creature, the task is hindered by an additional step. The difficulty returns to 2 after that creature rests for ten hours.

### Earth/Stone  
>Enabler  
>You are trained in climbing, stonecraft, and spelunking.

###  Knowledge/Wisdom  
>3 Intellect, Action  
>Choose up to three creatures (potentially including yourself). For one minute, a particular type of task (but not an attack roll or defense roll) is eased for those creatures, but only while they remain within immediate range of you.

###  Nature/Animals/Plants
>Enabler  
>You are trained in botany and handling natural animals.

###  Protection/Silence  
>3 Intellect, Action  
>You create a quiet bubble of protection around you to an immediate radius for one minute. The bubble moves with you. All defense rolls for you and all creatures you designate within the bubble are eased, and no noise, regardless of its origin, sounds louder than a normal speaking voice.

### Sky/Air  
>2 Intellect, Action  
>A creature you touch is immune to airborne toxins or contaminants for ten minutes.

### Sun/Light/Fire
> 2 Intellect, Action  
> You cause one creature or object within short range to catch fire, inflicting 1 point of ambient damage each round until the fire is extinguished (requiring an action).

### Trickery/Greed/Commerce  
>Enabler  
>You are trained in detecting the deceptions of other creatures.

### War  
>1 Intellect,  Action  
>A target you choose within short range (potentially yourself) deals 2 additional points of damage with its next successful weapon attack.

### Water/Sea  
>2 Intellect,  Action  
>A target you touch can breathe water for ten minutes.
