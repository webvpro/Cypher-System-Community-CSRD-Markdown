## Fruitfully Pass the Time  
>**Action**  
>4 Intellect points
  
You are trained in one performance skill, such as singing; playing a fiddle, harmonica, or other instrument; or something else that others would enjoy watching or hearing you do. When you perform with the skill gained through this ability for one minute and you succeed on a difficulty 3 performance roll, you and all allies within short range who can hear and see you immediately gain a one-action recovery roll. You can't use this on someone again until you use a one-hour or ten-hour recovery roll. Action to initiate, one minute to complete.
