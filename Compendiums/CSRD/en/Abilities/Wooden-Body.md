## Wooden Body    
>**Action**    
>1+ Might points  
    
You transform your body into living wood for ten minutes, which grants you several benefits. You gain +1 to Armor and you are practiced in using your limbs as medium weapons. You need about one-tenth as much air as a human. Hiding among trees or on a tree is eased. However, in your wooden form you move more stiffly than a creature of flesh, hindering your Speed defense rolls. Action to change or revert.	Your wooden body might be smooth like a polished board, rough like tree bark, or a mix of both.
