## Expert Skill  
>**Action**
  
Instead of rolling a d20, you can choose to automatically succeed on a task you're trained in. The task must be difficulty 4 or lower, and it can't be an attack roll or a defense roll. Enabler. (A character can't apply Effort or other abilities to any task they accomplish using Expert Skill.)
