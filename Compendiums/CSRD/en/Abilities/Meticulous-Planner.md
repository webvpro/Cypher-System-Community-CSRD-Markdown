## Meticulous Planner    
>**Enabler**  
    
If you spend a long time planning an action, you gain an asset on performing it. The time to study and plan for the action is ten times as long as it takes to perform the action. For example, if you want to jump across a hole in the floor (one action), you can study the area for ten rounds (about a minute), and when you attempt to jump over the hole, you have an asset on the jump. This benefit applies to only one roll-if you want to perform the task again with the benefit of an asset, you need to study and plan again. Enabler.
