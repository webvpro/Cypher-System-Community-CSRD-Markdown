## Soul Familiar
  
>**Enabler**  
  

  
You have a soul familiar who accompanies you and follows your instructions. Your soul and their soul are interconnected (or the familiar might actually be a physical manifestation of your soul). The familiar loves and cares for you like the best combination of a pet and a close friend. 
  

  
The familiar is no larger than a large cat (about 20 pounds, or 9 kg); a typical soul familiar looks like a bird, cat, rat, lizard, snake, or toad, but more unusual forms (such as a tiny demon, dragon, elemental, fey creature, or floating skull) are also possible. You and the GM must work out the details of your familiar, and you’ll probably make rolls for them in combat or when they take actions. The familiar acts on your turn. Their movement is based on their creature type (avian, swimmer, and so on).
  
You and your familiar can communicate telepathically within long range, or empathically within very long range. Beyond this range, you can only sense each other’s general level of well-being. 
  

  
Your familiar’s presence within short range counts as an asset for magical tasks that require at least one minute to activate or maintain. 
  

  
If your familiar is within an immediate distance of you, you can roll any defense task for them, gaining the benefit of your skills, assets, and Effort (the familiar’s Speed defense tasks are eased by two steps due to their size). While within this distance, your familiar also gains the benefit of any ongoing spell you cast on yourself (for example, if you cast a spell on yourself that lets you breathe water, your familiar can breathe water). 
  

  
Foes can use your soul familiar’s connection to you against you. If a foe is holding or restraining your familiar (or touching it while it is held or restrained by another creature or a device, such as manacles or a cage), the foe’s attacks and defenses against you are eased. 
  
If an attack against your familiar would reduce their health to 0, you can magically intervene so their health is instead reduced to 1 and you move one step down the damage track. If your familiar dies, you move one step down the damage track. If you die, your familiar instantly dies. 
  

  
You can replace a dead familiar (or revive them, if you have their remains) by performing a magical ritual that takes 1d6 days.

>level 2, Speed defense as level 4 due to size
  
A soul familiar with an animal form looks like a normal animal—there’s nothing obvious about them to indicate they’re anything other than what they appear to be.
