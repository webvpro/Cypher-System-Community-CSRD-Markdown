## Statue Stasis  
>**Action**    
>3 Intellect point  
  
You transform into a lifelike bronze or stone statue of yourself for a specific period of time (one minute, one hour, ten hours, or twenty-four hours). When in statue form, you are in stasis; you don’t age, can take no actions (other than making recovery rolls while you “sleep”), and gain +10 to Armor against all forms of damage, including damage not normally affected by Armor. If you take enough damage to get through your armor, the stasis effect immediately ends. Action.
