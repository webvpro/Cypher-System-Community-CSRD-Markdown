## Remote Slap  
>**Action**    
>3 Intellect point  
  
You use an active telephone, cellular, internet, or closed-circuit video connection to slap a creature. The target must be actively using a device making use of this connection, such as being on the other end of a phone call or text message, browsing the same social media website or app you’re using, or monitoring a closed-circuit camera that is recording you. Make an Intellect-based attack against the creature; success means the creature takes 1 point of damage, as if they had been telekinetically slapped in the face by the device they’re using. Each additional remote slap against that creature is hindered by an additional step (resetting after one hour). Action.
