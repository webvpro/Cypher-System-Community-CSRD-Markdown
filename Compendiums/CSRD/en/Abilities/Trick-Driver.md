## Trick Driver  
While driving a car, truck, or motorcycle, your Might Edge, Speed Edge, and Intellect Edge increase by 1. When you make a recovery roll while driving, you recover 5 additional points. When you attempt a driving task or an extreme trick-such as jumping a ravine or other vehicle, spinning in the air, landing safely on another vehicle, and so on-the task is eased. Enabler.
