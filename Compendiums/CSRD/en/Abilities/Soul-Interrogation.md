## Soul Interrogation  
>5  Intellect  
  
You determine the weaknesses, vulnerabilities, qualities, and mannerisms of a single creature within long range. The GM should reveal the creature's level, basic abilities, and obvious weaknesses (if any). All actions you attempt that affect that creature-attack, defense, interaction, and so on-are eased for a few months afterward. Action.
