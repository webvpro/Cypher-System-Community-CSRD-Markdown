## Spells Have No Speed Limit   
>**Enabler**    
Any car you have driven for at least a minute responds to you like a well-trained robot, allowing you to mentally give it orders from a long distance away.   
  
This control includes any aspect of driving the car (such as steering, accelerating, and braking) and any moveable parts on the car (such as opening or closing the doors, hood, or trunk). The car takes actions on your turn, and you make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. You can only control one car at a time with this ability (although you could manually drive one car and magically control another car at the same time). If you are driving the car youâ€™re controlling with this ability, your driving tasks and extreme tricks with the car (such as jumping a ravine or other vehicle, spinning in the air, landing safely on another vehicle, and so on) are eased. Enabler.
