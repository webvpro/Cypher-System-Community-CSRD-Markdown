## Tap Currents  
>**Action**    
You can draw energy from the earth itself into your body. If you concentrate and don’t move from where you’re standing for one minute, you restore 3 points to your Might or Speed Pool. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you’ve made a ten-hour recovery roll. If you have the Store Energy ability, you can instead use Tap Currents to add 3 points to your Siphon Pool. (This use of this ability is not limited to one use per ten-hour recovery roll.) Action to initiate.
