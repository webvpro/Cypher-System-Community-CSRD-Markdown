## Petrify    
>**Action**    
>1+ Intellect points  
    
You emit a cone of pale, cool moonlight from your hand, illuminating up to a short distance with dim light, lasting for one minute. As your action or as part of the action of activating this ability, you can tighten the beam so it focuses on one creature, inflicting either 4 points of cold damage or 2 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor), which immediately ends the spell. You automatically know if the struck creature is a shapechanger (such as a  werewolf), although this doesnâ€™t tell you what kind of shapechanger they are or what their true form is. Action.
