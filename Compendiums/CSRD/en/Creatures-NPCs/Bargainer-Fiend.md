Description text

> **Level :**  3
> **Health :**  9
> **Damage :** 4 points  
> **Armor :**  2

>[!example] Modifications  
>- Deception as level 5 
   
> [!example] Interactions  
> Running, at least from the malevolent ones, is typically the best course of action. Dealing with helpful black dogs is often an interesting and unexpected experience, as they don't talk and don't explain who they choose to help or why.  

>[!example] Uses  
>A motivational speaker offers to teach clients confidence and charm, with great results. An old sorcerer knows some rare magic for those willing to pay a steep price. A mysterious person has been seen visiting people in the terminal ward of various hospitals. 

> [!example] Loot  
> A bargainer fiend may have a cypher relating to their duties or as a gift or payment for a client, but most of their material riches are hell-crafted and not safe to carry for long.

>[!example] Combat   
>> A bargainer fiend attacks with a punch or a firearm. If they aren’t trying to hide their inhuman nature, they throw short-range bolts of painful hellfire, inflicting 4 points of damage and stunning the target for one round.  
> 
>>  The heart of a bargainer fiend’s power is its ability to arrange for rewards for a mortal client in exchange for the client’s soul. Typical rewards are training in a skill, learning a new type or focus ability, wealth equivalent to one exorbitant item, an artifact, or anything else that can be acquired by spending 4 XP. The price is always the client’s mortal soul, usually after a specific time period. Bigger demands by the client require the fiend to get approval from their superiors, and the price is higher, but usually still manageable.  
>  
>  >A bargainer fiend can use an action to transform themself into a human or near-human form (such as a human with devil horns) or return to their natural form. They can assume the guise of a specific human (such as a person their client knows) only if that human is dead or has an agreement with a bargainer fiend. 

> [!example] Intrusions 
> Bargainer fiends serve at the pleasure of their infernal masters, and they know their lives are forfeit if they ever fail. This colors their interactions with clients; they will say anything to accomplish their mission, and their only true loyalty is to the fiend who created and controls them.
