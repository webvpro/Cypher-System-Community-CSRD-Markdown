## Enchanter  
Enchanters include magic-users of all genders. They may choose to call themselves wizards, sorcerers, mages, or diviners, depending on their strengths, abilities, and desired reputations.
Enchanters usually take great pride in their appearance, including their outfits, accouterments, and equipment. They often incorporate living or dead elements of dangerous creatures, such as spiders, snakes, crocodiles, and dragons, into the objects that matter to them. Additionally, they may imbue objects with powerful magic.
Enchanters can use long-lasting or even permanent versions of their magical abilities, but doing so usually requires minutes or hours of time.
Most enchanters have one or more apprentices or helpers, typically animals that have been made human temporarily or humans who are in the service of the enchanter until some debt of theirs or their family's has been paid.

> **Environment: ** Everywhere, particularly in places where magic is present and powerful  
> **Interactions: ** For the characters, an enchanter may be a terrifying foe or a powerful ally. Enchanters are fickle, perhaps due to their close relationship with magic, and may change their loyalties on a whim or an imagined slight.  
> **Uses: **The characters need to have an object imbued, a person returned to life, or a curse undone, and they turn to the enchanter for help. The characters accidentally insulted the enchanter in some way, and now the enchanter is hunting them down to get revenge.  
> **Loot: **Enchanters often protect their precious items with spells and magical locks (level 8). Behind those wards are 1d6 cyphers, an artifact, and an elegant or interesting outfit.

> **Combat:** 
> Magical weapons and artifacts (such as a whip made of living snakes, a staff with a
biting wolf's head on top, or a sword that acts of its own accord) do 5 points of damage. Additionally, an enchanter may employ a number of magical abilities, including the
Following:
Animate: Takes any material (such as wood or stone) and turns it into an animate level
4 creature. The creature has a mind and will of its own, and acts just as that type of
creature would act if it were born instead of created.
Blood to Stone: Turns living creatures into stone, or immobilizes them in their current form. Breaking free is a level 6 Might task.
Enchant: Imbues a normal object with a magical power. The object works under the
enchanter's command, and does as the enchanter asks of it. For example, an enchanter might imbue a foe's weapon and force it to attack the foe, or they might imbue a door and have it close tight against incoming dangers.
Endless Passage: Creates an endless series of thick spiderwebs, invisible barriers, rings of flame, or other hurdles across an entrance, exit, tunnel, or passage. Every time one of the hurdles is broken, another forms. Characters' movement is halved while going through the endless passage, and they take 2 points of Intellect damage each round.
Invisible: Turns anything (including themselves, others, and entire areas up to 30 feet by 30 feet [9 m by 9 m]) invisible for ten minutes. It's a level 6 Intellect task to be able to see something that has been made invisible.
Persuasion: Convinces all victims in long range that what they believe is not real or that what is false is real. Sometimes this ability just affects others' minds, creating a mental dissonance. Other times, the enchanter creates an illusion or other visible, auditory, and tactile element that persuades a character to believe everything they are
experiencing. The effect lasts for ten minutes. Additionally, an enchanter may have one or more of the same abilities as a witch or a faerie.
