## Wind Children    
The children of the wind cannot be measured in known numbers, for they are here and there and everywhere. They are not born, so much as borne, by weather patterns, wishes, and wants. Dust devils, gales, and zephyrs are all wind children.

> **Interactions: ** Interacting with wind children is a bit like interacting with a group of mischievous, precocious, and spoiled kids. However, they know many things, having been all over the world, and will often share what they know in exchange for new secrets or knowledge.    
> **Uses: **One of the PCs seeks information about a person, place, or thing. The characters need a surreptitious spy to gather information for them.    
> **Loot: **Information, secrets, and possibly a cypher or two picked up during their travels.
