## Giant Spider  
Giant spiders result most commonly from radioactive accidents, magic, or genetic manipulation. Whatever their origin, they're terrifying hunters large enough to predate people. The creatures range from the size of a large dog to the size of a large horse.

> **Environment: ** Anywhere webs can be spun in the dark  
> **Interactions: ** Most giant spiders are simple predators and react accordingly.  
> **Uses: **Giant spider webs can infest unlit alleys, dungeon corridors, dark forests, and darkened hallways of decommissioned genetic labs.  
> **Loot: **Cocooned corpses of previous victims hanging in a giant spider's web sometimes contain all manner of valuables, including cyphers.  
> **GM Intrusion: ** Giant spider webs can infest unlit alleys, dungeon corridors, dark forests, and darkened hallways of decommissioned genetic labs.  

> **Combat:** 
> A giant spider's envenomed fangs inflict 3 points of damage, plus 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) if a victim fails a Might defense roll. Debilitated victims are not killed but instead cocooned and hung for later dining. Giant spider webs (level 4) can hold victims immobile and unable to take actions until they manage to break free.
Giant spiders lose their perception and Speed defense modifications in bright light and thus often retreat from intense illumination.  
  

> **Intrusions: ** 
> Giant spider eggs hatch, and a level 3 swarm of tiny spiders attacks the character.
