> **Interactions: ** Children are often smarter, more creative, and more wily than they're given credit for. They may have a lot of knowledge about nearby people, places, and activities that can help the PCs, particularly if there's an exchange of food, money, or other goodies involved.  
> **Uses: **Someone or something is stealing children from the village, and the mayor is offering to pay a large sum to anyone who tracks down the creature and rescues the children. One of the PCs catches a waif stealing from their pack in the night; the child says they've been lost in the woods for days.  
> **Loot: **Children typically have very little on their person, although they may have a special memento of their family or a close friend.  
> **GM Intrusion: ** Someone or something is stealing children from the village, and the mayor is offering to pay a large sum to anyone who tracks down the creature and rescues the children. One of the PCs catches a waif stealing from their pack in the night; the child says they've been lost in the woods for days.  

> **Combat:** 
> Most children fight only in response to being provoked, threatened, or attacked. They typically use makeshift weapons, such as their fists, a stick, or a toy.  
  

> **Intrusions: ** 
> The child shouts, laughs, or talks too loudly, accidentally drawing the attention of a nearby guard toward a character. Someone mistakenly thinks a character has stolen the child, and attacks them.
