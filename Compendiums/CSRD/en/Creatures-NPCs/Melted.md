## Melted  
Survivors assume the melted are another strain of mutants. Maybe so, but they're not originally from Earth. Or rather, not this Earth. The melted leaked in from a parallel world's apocalypse caused by a snafu with a high energy supercollider. Dozens of different but parallel timelines smashed into each other. The few survivors were fused beings composed of many different alternate versions of the same person, each still "radioactive" with latent transdimensional energy.

If a melted defeats a foe, they "consume" it by drawing it fully into their body cavity as their action, healing the melted for 10 health and giving the creature a few hours free of pain, allowing their mind to clear. 
A given melted may also have a trait associated with the transdimensional energy they burn with.
