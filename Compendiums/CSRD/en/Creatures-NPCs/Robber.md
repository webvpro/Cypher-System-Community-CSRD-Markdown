## Robber    
Robbers, thieves, highwaymen, robin hoods--whatever name you call them, they want what you have, and they're willing to get it any way they can. Some robbers are honorable, stealing only from the rich or the evil. Others will take anything that isn't nailed down or magically protected.  
Robbers often travel in pairs or small groups of dedicated friends and fellow robbers.

> **Environment: ** Anywhere there's something to be stolen    
> **Interactions: ** Most robbers have a moral code of some sort--it just may not be the code that others abide by. Still, they are willing to listen to reason (and particularly the sound of sliding coins). Robbers are often willing to be hired for jobs that are too difficult for others.

> **Loot: **Depending on whether they've just robbed someone or not, robbers may have anywhere from nothing (other than their weapons and clothing) up to the currency equivalent of a very expensive item.    
> **GM Intrusion: ** Robbers happen upon the place where the characters have made camp, and ask to join them. A group of robbers arrives to steal a thing that the characters are just about to steal themselves.    
  
> **Combat:**   
> Robbers typically prefer light and medium weapons, particularly bows and small blades.    
    
  
> **Intrusions: **   
> The robber's arrow manages to hit two foes in a single attack, or the robber shoots two arrows at multiple foes.
