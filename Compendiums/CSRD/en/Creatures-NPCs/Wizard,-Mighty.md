## Wizard, Mighty    
Some wizards learn so many spells and accumulate so much lore that they become incredibly powerful. Some work for a higher purpose, whereas others are concerned only with themselves.

> **Environment: ** NA    
> **Interactions: ** Care should be taken when negotiating with wizards because they are subtle and quick to anger. Even when negotiations succeed, a wizard's suggestions are usually cryptic and open to interpretation. A mighty wizard might be convinced to teach a character how to cast a spell.    
> **Uses: **A wizard is putting together a team to challenge a great foe, and the PCs fit the bill.    
> **Loot: **A mighty wizard has 1d6 cyphers.    
> **GM Intrusion: ** A wizard is putting together a team to challenge a great foe, and the PCs fit the bill.    
  
> **Combat:**   
> When a wizard makes a long-range attack with their staff or strikes someone with it, arcane energy damages the target and, if desired, all creatures the wizard selects within short range of the target. Targets that are within immediate range of the wizard when they take damage are thrown out of immediate range.  
A mighty wizard knows many spells, including spells that grant +5 to Armor for an hour, spells of teleportation, spells of finding, and so on. A wizard also likely carries several cyphers useful in combat.    
    
  
> **Intrusions: **   
> The wizard casts two spells as a single action instead of just one.
