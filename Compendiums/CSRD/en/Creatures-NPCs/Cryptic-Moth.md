## Cryptic Moth  
Normal moths are enigmatic, gauzy haunts of twilight. The feathery touch of their wings on your face can startle, even frighten. This is to be expected, since moths are the children of cryptic moths, malign and intelligent entities of another realm. Sometimes referred to as mothmen, other times as shadow faeries, cryptic moths are certainly alien. Each possesses a unique wing pattern and coloration, and, to some extent, body shape. These patterns
and colors may signify where in the hierarchy a particular cryptic moth stands among its siblings of the night, but for those who do not speak the language of moths, the complexity of their social structure is overwhelming.

> **Environment: ** Almost anywhere, usually at night  
> **Interactions: ** Although very few cryptic moths speak human languages, peaceful interaction with these creatures is not impossible. It's just extremely difficult, as they see most humans as a source of food or bodies to lay their eggs in.  
> **Uses: **A character is followed by a cryptic moth intent on capturing and enslaving them.  
> **Loot: **A cryptic moth usually has a few cyphers, and possibly a delicate artifact.  
> **GM Intrusion: ** A character is followed by a cryptic moth intent on capturing and enslaving them.  

> **Combat:** 
> Cryptic moths usually enter combat only when they wish, because until they attack and become visible, they can remain unseen and invisible to most eyes. The touch of a cryptic moth's wing draws life and energy from targets, inflicting 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor).
Cryptic moths regain 1 point of health per round while their health is above 0, unless they've been damaged with a silvered or cold iron weapon, or by electrical attacks. 
Once every hour or so, a cryptic moth can summon a swarm of normal moths to aid them in combat or, more often, serve as a fashion accessory or component in a piece of living art.
	Moth swarm: level 2
If a cryptic moth is prepared, it may carry cyphers useful in combat, and perhaps even an artifact.  
  

> **Intrusions: ** 
> The cryptic moth grabs the character and flies up and away, taking the victim with them.
