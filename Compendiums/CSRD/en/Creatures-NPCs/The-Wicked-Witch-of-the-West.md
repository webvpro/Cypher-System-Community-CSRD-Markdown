## The Wicked Witch of the West  
With her three pigtails and diminutive stature, it would be easy to write off the Wicked Witch of the West as a nobody--and many have--but her power lies in the creatures that work for her and in her vast and growing collection of magical footwear.
She can see up to 2 miles (3 km) away with her single eye, and wears galoshes that give her +2 Armor against water and liquid of all kinds.

> **Uses: **The characters need to find galoshes of fortune and decide to steal a pair from the Wicked Witch of the West. Perhaps they need to make it through the land she presides over and must find a way to get her approval.
