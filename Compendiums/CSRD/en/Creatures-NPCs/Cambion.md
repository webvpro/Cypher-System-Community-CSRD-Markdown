## Cambion  
Fine ebony scales cover a cambion's perfectly athletic figure. Two reddish horns grow from
its brow, and the tips of fangs emerge from between its dusky lips. Its eyes, absent iris and
pupil, are the color of driven snow. Cambions are cursed creatures, born of mortal and
demonic parentage, and are also sometimes called helborn. Most cambions give in to what
everyone expects of them, and embrace evil.

> **Combat:** 
> Cambions sometimes wield heavy weapons in combat, especially if they come across an artifact that can enhance their attacks. Some cambions develop their natural and magical abilities to become powerful sorcerers, but most can call up hellish energy merely by willing it at least once per day, as follows.
Finger of Torture: A ruby ray lances out from the cambion's finger to strike an enemy prone with torturous pain on a failed Might defense task. The target automatically takes 6 points of damage each round until they can escape the effect with an Intellect task.
Soulfire Blast: An explosion of soul-rending black and crimson fire explodes around up to three targets standing next to each other within short range, inflicting 4 points of damage and stunning the targets so that they lose their next action on a failed Speed defense task.
