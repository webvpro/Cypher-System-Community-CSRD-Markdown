## Crafter    
Crafters include bakers, cobblers, candlemakers, butchers, millers, tailors, woodworkers, and cooks. While most crafters aren't particularly agile fighters, they are usually clever and strong, and have a number of familiar tools at their disposal for weapons.

> **Environment: ** In their workshops or peddling their trade while traveling    
> **Interactions: ** Most crafters are happy to talk about their craft or the objects that they've made and have for sale. They take pride in their work, and flattery and attention can go a long way.    
> **Uses: **To the PCs, crafters can be allies, obstacles, or both. Being friends with a crafter often has obvious long-term benefits, while stealing from them has short-term advantages (and possible long-term disadvantages).    
> **Loot: **A crafter has currency equivalent to an inexpensive item, as well as crafting tools and materials and anything they've crafted that they're carrying or wearing.    
> **GM Intrusion: ** To the PCs, crafters can be allies, obstacles, or both. Being friends with a crafter often has obvious long-term benefits, while stealing from them has short-term advantages (and possible long-term disadvantages).    
  
> **Combat:**   
> Crafters are unlikely to initiate combat, as most just want to be left alone to do their work (or to convince you to buy their wares). If they're forced to fight, they will typically use any item they have at hand (such as a rolling pin, butcher's knife, crafting tool, or length of wood).    
    
  
> **Intrusions: **   
> The crafter uses their crafting tool in a way that the character didn't anticipate, putting the character in a disadvantaged position.
