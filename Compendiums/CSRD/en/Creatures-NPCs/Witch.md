## Witch  
Witches are complex beings of myriad personalities, desires, and abilities. Sometimes they're the stuff of nightmares, with tales of their exploits keeping children safe in their beds during the darkest hours. Other times they're wise helpers--at least for a little
while, or possibly for a price. Often, they're a little of everything, taking on no end of roles throughout their lifetime. They may isolate themselves deep in the dark woods, falsify their way into a royal family, or reside in the middle of town, hiding their identity.
But one thing they are, always, is dangerous, for they carry within their hearts and heads knowledge, power, and magic--and a willingness to use all of them when necessary. Motive: Domination of others, power, knowledge, eternal life or beauty, hunger, revenge Environment: Almost anywhere, although most often alone in unique dwellings in the
forest, in civilization as healers, or having infiltrated royal families

> **Damage :** 5 points  
> **Armor :** 0  
> **Movement :** Short; long if flying  
> **Environment: ** Almost anywhere, usually alone, but sometimes as part of a coven of three to seven witches  
> **Interactions: ** Most witches are deceptive and conniving, though a few work against the stereotype. All witches are willing to negotiate, though the devious ones usually do so in bad faith.  
> **Uses: **The PCs need an old book to continue their investigation. Word is that the old woman who lives on the edge of the woods has the only copy.  
> **Loot: **A witch usually has an artifact or two on their person, possibly including a flying broom (which has a depletion roll of 1 in 1d10).  
> **GM Intrusion: ** The PCs need an old book to continue their investigation. Word is that the old woman who lives on the edge of the woods has the only copy.  

> **Combat:** 
> In addition to inflicting damage with their weapon of choice (often a staff or long, curved blade), witches can curse their enemies. They also have a number of spells and abilities at their disposal. These include the Following:
Familiar: When attacked, a witch relies on the aid of their familiar to improve their Speed defense. The familiar could be a large black cat, an owl, a big snake, or some other creature. Killing a witch's familiar is so shocking to a witch that their attacks and Speed defense are hindered for a few days. It's also a way to ensure that the witch never forgives their foe or grants mercy. (Familiar: level 3; health 9; Armor 1)
Glamour: Glamour is an illusion that the witch creates. It may let them look like someone else, appear to be a tree or a bird, or even make them invisible. Seeing through the glamour is a level 8 Intellect task. A failed attempt inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage. Once a character sees through the glamour, they cannot unsee it.
Heal: The witch touches another creature and heals them for 6 points of damage. Some witches must pull health from another living being in long range in order to use this ability. Pulling health from a living being inflicts 2 points of damage on that being.
Imprison: The witch creates a prison within long range and captures a foe inside it as a single action. The prison might be physical (a tower, a cage, a trap, a binding around the body) or mental (they can't move, their muscles are no longer under their control, they are afraid to move). Resisting being caught is a level 5 defense task (Might, Speed, or Intellect, depending on the type of imprisonment). If a character is caught, breaking free is a level 5 task (of the appropriate stat).
Protect: Places a confinement spell to keep someone from going in or out of a location, building, or room. Those who attempt to pass through the spell but fail take 3 points of Intellect damage and are knocked back. Once the spell activates, it disappears.
Revive: This rare and costly ability allows a witch to bring someone back to life, as long as they haven't been dead for more than a year. In order to accomplish this, the witch needs all or part of the body of the dead, a beloved object of the dead's, and the willingness of someone else to take on a curse that results from the magical working (roll on the Curse table to determine the resulting curse). Revive takes ten minutes to cast, and the character returns to life with 1 point in all of their Pools.
Seduce: Creatures within short range who fail an Intellect defense roll become enamored of the witch. Resisting the witch's persuasion attempts is hindered by two steps until the victim succeeds on an Intellect defense roll; each time they fail to resist the persuasion attempt, the witch's next persuasion attempt is eased by an additional step.
Additional abilities: Witches might also have access to the witch abilities in the Cypher System Rulebook. These are charm, hexbolt, shrivel, and vitality. Some witches might have other magical abilities similar to those of enchanters.
Charm: Victims within short range who fail an Intellect defense roll are enslaved. Victims turn on their allies or take some other action described by their new master. The curse lasts for one minute, or until the victims succeed on an Intellect defense roll; each time they fail a roll, the next roll is hindered by one additional step.
Hexbolt: A victim within long range is attacked with fire, cold, or psychic
bolts, as the witch chooses. Psychic bolts deal 3 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor).
Shrivel: A victim within long range and up to two creatures next to the victim must succeed on a Might defense roll or take 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). In each subsequent round, a victim who failed the previous roll must make another Might defense roll with the same outcome on failure.
Vitality: The witch regains 11 points of health and gains +3 to Armor for one minute. Multiple uses don't further improve Armor.  
  

> **Intrusions: ** 
> The witch's familiar joins the fray, tripping up characters and hindering their actions. Something startles the witch and they cast a curse or spell as an automatic response. The witch pulls out an artifact or cypher and prepares to use it. After a character succeeds on a defense roll against one of the witch's ongoing curse effects, the witch immediately tosses a hexbolt at them. If the character is hit, the ongoing curse effect also continues.
