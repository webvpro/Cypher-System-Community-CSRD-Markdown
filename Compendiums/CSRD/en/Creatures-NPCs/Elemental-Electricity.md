## Elemental, Air    
Electricity elementals alternate between a feral-looking humanoid energy form and a near-spherical cloud of intensely glowing sparks. They spontaneously arise when supernatural events take place near high-voltage wires or electrical substations, and their high rate of speed often means they’ve traveled hundreds of miles before anyone realizes they appeared. Extremely mobile and curious, they inadvertently or deliberately cause harm wherever they go.

> **Health :** 24    
> **Damage :** 4 points    
> **Armor :** 0    
> **Movement :**Short; very long with electrical conduction  
  
> **Modifications**    
>- Attacks and Speed defense as level 5 due to quickness; stealth as level 2 due to buzzing noise   
  
> **Environment: ** Anywhere electricity can easily reach    
  
> **Interactions: **Electricity elementals are somewhat intelligent but perceive and think at much faster rates than humans, so they quickly become frustrated with “slow” communication. They can be summoned and controlled with magic, but there’s a 10% chance the elemental breaks free of the spell and attacks or flees.  
   
> **Uses: **  Power grid fluctuations throughout the city may be the result of a roving electricity elemental. Something exploded every car battery along a major street. Something noisy has taken over the eccentric inventor’s workshop.  
   
> **Loot: **NA    
  
> **Combat:**   
> An electricity elemental strikes twice each round with a limb, or fires one bolt of electricity at a target within short range.   
>   
> As its action, an elemental can heal itself for up to 4 points of health by draining power from a touched electrical machine, creature (such as a robot), manifest cypher, or artifact. A drained object moves one step down the object damage track. A drained robot takes 4 points of damage. A drained manifest cypher is fully consumed and useless. A drained artifact immediately checks for depletion (artifacts with a depletion of “—” are either immune to this ability or have a depletion of 1 in 1d10 for this purpose).   
>   
> An electricity elemental can pass through conductive materials at full speed, ignoring obstacles and difficult terrain. An electricity elemental can power any electrical device that runs on household power, but it’s uncomfortable for them and they don’t like doing it.
