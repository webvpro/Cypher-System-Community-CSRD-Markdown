## Gargoyle    
Sounds with no apparent origin, such as the tap of footsteps on the stair, knocking behind the walls, crying from empty rooms, and haunting music, might be signs of a ghost. If the sound is accompanied by a sudden temperature drop and the breath of living creatures begins to steam, it's a certainty.  
Ghosts are the spectral remnants of humans, which persist either as fragments of memory or as full-fledged spirits. Though their appearance varies between individuals, many appear somewhat translucent, washed out, or physically warped from their time spent as a phantom.    
  
    
> **Level :** 4    
> **Health :** 12    
> **Damage :** 4 points    
> **Armor :** 3   
> **Movement :** Short; long while flying   
> **Motive:** Guarding   
  
> **Modifications**    
>- Seeing through deception, stealth, hiding, and sneaking as level 6   
    
> **Environment: ** Cities, especially on older buildings   
  
> **Interactions: ** Some ghosts are talkative, some don't know they're dead, some want help for a task they failed to accomplish in life, and some only rage against the living and want to bring those who yet breathe into the same colorless existence they endure.    
> **Uses: ** Gargoyles work best when used to defend something. PCs can end up at odds with a gargoyle who thinks (incorrectly or correctly) that their beloved building is in danger, or have to find a gargoyle that for some reason has gone missing from their customary perch.  
> **Loot: ** NA  
  
> **Combat:**   
>Most gargoyles don’t wish to fight and will do so only reluctantly or if something or someone they’re guarding is threatened. Their most basic attack is to throw or fly themselves fully at their foe, hitting the target with their entire body for 4 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor), but they may claw twice, inflicting 4 points of damage with each attack.   
>  
>Gargoyles can see in darkness as if it were daylight.   
>Gargoyles have a number of additional combat options and other abilities at their disposal, including the following:   
> - **Awaken Friend:** Awaken another gargoyle out of its inanimate state and ask it to help. This other gargoyle must be within short range, it acts on the same initiative as the asking gargoyle, and it can take actions starting the turn after it is awakened.   
> - **Bulwark:** Grow to twice their size to prevent others from getting through a doorway or other opening. They are able to stretch out their wings, limbs, and even other body parts to fill the entirety of the space.While in this form they cannot move or attack, but they can return to their normal size as part of another action.   
> - **Take the Attack:** Move up to a short distance on someone else’s turn to take an attack directed at the person, place, or object they’re guarding. Other than the distance traveled, this works like the taking the attack cooperative action. (Typically, the gargoyle relies on its Armor to absorb most of this damage.)   
> - **Water Spout:** Open their mouth and emit a powerful short-distance stream of water that inflicts 4 points of damage to everyone in its path.   
  
> **Interaction:**   
> While gargoyles can be conscripted and tricked into guarding, they’re much more likely to throw themselves into the job if someone takes the time to earn their loyalty. They are not always the smartest, but they are very “grumpy sunshine” and often quite funny.   
  
> **Gargoyle Names: **   
> All gargoyles have a name, even those that may not have left their dormancy for the first time. However, few will tell someone their real name, as they have a healthy fear of that knowledge being used for ill. Instead, they offer up a nickname, usually something similar, at least until they learn to trust someone fully.
