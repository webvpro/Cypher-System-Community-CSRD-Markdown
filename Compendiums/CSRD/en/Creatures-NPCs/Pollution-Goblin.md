## Pollution Goblin  
Pollution goblins are strange child-sized creatures that arise in environments where pollution or toxic waste is common. Their green skin is covered in scabs and pustules, except where it looks melted by acid, and their eyes have a wicked green glow that’s faintly visible in the dark. They don’t seem to have much of a culture or society, roaming around polluted areas like scavenging insects. They often ignore each other’s presence and never attack each other, but they immediately unite against a common foe if any of them are threatened. A pollution goblin’s semi-liquefied body can slide up or down any firm surface, allowing them to climb anywhere with ease. Pollution goblins have bones and internal organs, but they’re oddly shaped and don’t match those of any known creature. Because of this, and how they quickly melt away if killed, they might actually be artificial beings like homunculi, or inanimate matter given life like an elemental. They seem to arise  
spontaneously in locations where pollution reaches a threshold, and they don’t reproduce in the normal biological sense. Pollution goblins are stupid and easily tricked, but it doesn’t take long for them to realize they’ve been deceived, and they always make sure to punish someone who fools them.

> **Environment: ** Anywhere there is pollution, in groups of three to ten   
   
> **Uses: **: Pollution goblins are an early symptom of a larger and greater problem. By the time a group of them is discovered, the area is already poisoned and will take time and money to contain and clean up.   
  
> **Loot: ** NA  
  
> **Combat:**   
>Pollution goblins use scavenged weapons to attack prey at range, preferring stolen pistols (usually with only one or two bullets left) or hurled containers of toxic goo. When up close, they bite.   
>  
>A pollution goblin’s body is infused with dangerous chemicals. Any person spending their turn within immediate range of a pollution goblin must succeed at a Might defense roll or become sick. Within an hour, all their tasks are hindered, and for every 24 hours that pass, they must make another Might defense roll or move one step down the damage track (a success ends the sickness).   
>  
>Pollution goblins regain 2 points of health per round.   
  
> **Interaction:**   
>  Pollution goblins have a rudimentary understanding of whatever human language is dominant in their area. Most conversations with them are about acquiring food and protecting and expanding their territory (which means spreading contaminants over a wider area).
