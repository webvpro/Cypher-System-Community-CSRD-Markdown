## Mummy  
Mummies are intelligent undead, usually royalty or members of the priesthood, risen from their burial places to destroy those who disturbed their rest. Many seek to undo wrongs against them from ages past or re-establish themselves in their former high stations.

> **Combat:** 
> Mummies are strong, capable of lifting an adult human with one hand and throwing the person across a room. They attack with weapons that were buried with them or use their fists. A mummy usually has one or more of the following abilities: 
Curse: Anyone who disturbs a mummy's tomb must make an Intellect defense roll or become cursed, which hinders their
actions by two steps (forever, or until cured). 
Disease: The mummy's attacks carry a rotting disease. The target must make a level 5 Might defense roll every twelve hours or take 5 points of ambient damage.
Lifelike appearance: A mummy can repair its body to assume a fully human appearance. This usually requires time and the flesh of several people, often those who awakened it.
Magic: Once per hour, the mummy can cast a spell from the Minor Wish character ability.
Minion: Animate up to four mummified bodies as mindless lesser mummies or skeletons (depending on how well the bodies are preserved), lasting for one day. 
	Lesser mummy: level 3, climb and stealth as level 4; health 12; Armor 1
Swarm: Call a swarm of bugs (usually scarab beetles or scorpions) to attack a foe or obscure vision.
	Swarm of bugs: level 3  
  

> **Intrusions: ** 
> A dying mummy speaks a curse upon those who killed it, hindering all their actions by two steps (forever, or until cured). What was overlooked as a fake or a prop turns out to be an actual mummy and attacks a character.
