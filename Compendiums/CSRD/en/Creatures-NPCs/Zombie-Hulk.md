## Zombie Hulk  
Most zombies are mindless, shambling, hungry, and infectious. Some varieties, despite their semblance to corpses, enjoy a regenerative process that keeps them active regardless of grievous wounds, rotting flesh, and sometimes missing limbs or organs. That same process kicks into overdrive in zombie hulks, converting everything they eat into additional mass and muscle. The result is three times as massive as a regular zombie and five times as dangerous.
ZOMBIE SPRINTER: Instead of being much larger than normal, a zombie's regenerative system can imbue it with incredible quickness, making it much faster than the shamblers often encountered. The resulting zombie sprinter's speed and ferocity make it hard to escape.
Zombie sprinter: level 3, initiative as level 5; moves a long distance each round; three bites per round inflict 3 damage each; retains 1 health if attack roll result that would have downed it was an even number

Alternatively, a zombie hulk can bite a target. When this occurs, it's almost impossible to force the hulk's jaws apart again. When a target takes damage from a bite, they must also succeed on a Speed defense roll or one of their limbs is clamped in the hulk's mouth. The target automatically takes damage each round they are caught, and all their tasks are hindered, including attempts to escape. Meanwhile, the hulk is free to bash other foes as its action even as it chews on a previously caught target. 
If an attack would reduce the zombie hulk's health to 0, it does so only if the number rolled for the attack was an even number; otherwise, the zombie is reduced to 1 point of health instead.
