## Devolved  
Conglomerate security subsidiaries regularly experiment with new ways to create super-soldiers, either to supply to a government on a contract basis, or to use for themselves. These experiments produced hundreds of dead ends-literally-plus a few dangerous failures. The devolved are one of those dangerous failures. These malformed, hideous brutes share a common heritage but display a wide array of maladies and mutations in the flesh, including withered limbs or elephantine patches of thick, scaly skin, misplaced body parts, and mental abnormalities. Simple-minded and afflicted with pain from their twisted, broken forms, the devolved vent all their hatred and wrath against all others. 
	Even successfully created super-soldiers require a regular regimen of specialized drugs to keep them healthy. Most are shipped out to fight on faraway fronts, whether that's on a distant space station, moon, or in another star system entirely. Without their drugs, they may devolve.

> **Environment: ** Groups of three to five, usually in locations where organized security can't easily reach  
> **Interactions: ** Devolved speak when they must, punctuating their statements with growls and barks. Their understanding seems limited to what they can immediately perceive, and they have a difficult time with abstract concepts.  
> **Uses: **An expedition to a ruined conglomerate research facility uncovers a cyst of devolved that live within its sheltering bunkers.  
> **Loot: **For every three or so devolved, one is likely to carry a cypher  
> **GM Intrusion: ** An expedition to a ruined conglomerate research facility uncovers a cyst of devolved that live within its sheltering bunkers.  

> **Combat:** 
> Devolved attack with a claw, a bite, or some other body part, inflicting 6 points of damage. They throw themselves at their enemies with mindless ferocity and little regard for their own safety. Easily frustrated, a devolved grows stronger as its fury builds. Each time it misses with an attack, the next attack is eased by one additional step and the damage it inflicts increases by 2 points (to a maximum of 12 points). Once the devolved successfully inflicts damage on a target, the amount of damage it inflicts and the difficulty of its attacks returns to normal. Then the cycle starts anew.  
  

> **Intrusions: ** 
> The devolved detonates upon its death, inflicting 6 points of damage on everything in immediate range.
