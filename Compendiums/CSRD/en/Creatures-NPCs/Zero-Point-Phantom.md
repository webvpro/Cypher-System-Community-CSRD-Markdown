## Zero-Point Phantom    
Temporary violations of conservation of energy mean that "virtual particles" constantly and seemingly randomly pop out of nothing, briefly interact with normal matter, then disappear. Zero-point phantoms are collections of such particles, taking the form of a very large, almost spider-like entity of many legs, stalks, and arms. What they're doing when they're not manifest is unknown; are they entombed in nearby solids, phased into another dimension, or do they simply not exist until they are called into being by some random cosmic event? Whatever the case, zero-point phantoms seem to prefer unlit or dimly lit areas in spacecraft and stations far from any planet, when they seem to struggle out of solid surfaces, raising a cloud of shadow.

> **Combat:**   
> A zero-point phantom attacks with needlelike leg and tentacle tips. A victim that takes damage must succeed on a Might defense task, or become poisoned, the effect of which is to drop them one step on the damage track. The victim must keep fighting off the poison until they succeed or drop three steps on the damage track; however, those who fall to the third step on the damage track from a phantom's poison are not dead. They are paralyzed and can't move for about a minute. If a phantom isn't otherwise occupied, it can grab a paralyzed victim and phase back into non-existence. Most victims phased away in this fashion are never seen again.   
Zero-point phantoms can stutter in and out of existence on their turn once every few minutes. When they do, they return with full health.    
    
  
> **Intrusions: **   
> Nearby light sources fail. Attacks and defenses against the zero- point phantoms are hindered by two steps for characters unable to see in the dark.
