## Mad Scientist  
A mad scientist is someone who delves into areas of science best left unexamined, abandoning ethics and pushing for what can be created without asking if it should be.

> **Uses: **Blackouts and strange noises have been traced to a location found to hold a secret lab where a scientist is creating something amazing and monstrous.  
> **Loot: **Mad scientists have a few manifest cyphers and possibly an artifact.

> **Combat:** 
> Mad scientists are usually accompanied by security guards, robots, zombies, or some other appropriate creature. A mad scientist can attempt to take command of an enemy's technological device (armor, a weapon, a cypher, a robot, and so on) within short range for up to one minute using a handheld device.
Mad scientists usually have access to a long-range energy or high-velocity weapon that inflicts 7 points of damage. They often carry manifest cyphers that increase Armor, confuse opponents' senses, or transform themselves into a form that eases all their actions by two steps.  
  

> **Intrusions: ** 
> The mad scientist produces a gadget or cypher that proves to be the perfect answer to a dilemma at hand.
