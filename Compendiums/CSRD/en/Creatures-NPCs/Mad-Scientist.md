## Mad Scientist    
A mad scientist is someone who delves into areas of science best left unexamined, abandoning ethics and pushing for what can be created without asking if it should be.

> **Environment: ** Usually in a lab    
> **Interactions: ** Mad scientists are narcissistic and love to monologue about their work. They negotiate but usually are sociopathic and don't care about other people. Some are filled with self-loathing but too far gone to feel they can change.    
> **Uses: **Blackouts and strange noises have been traced to a location found to hold a secret lab where a scientist is creating something amazing and monstrous.    
> **Loot: **Mad scientists have a few manifest cyphers and possibly an artifact.    
> **GM Intrusion: ** Blackouts and strange noises have been traced to a location found to hold a secret lab where a scientist is creating something amazing and monstrous.    
  
> **Combat:**   
> Mad scientists are usually accompanied by security guards, robots, zombies, or some other appropriate creature. A mad scientist can attempt to take command of an enemy's technological device (armor, a weapon, a cypher, a robot, and so on) within short range for up to one minute using a handheld device.  
Mad scientists usually have access to a long-range energy or high-velocity weapon that inflicts 7 points of damage. They often carry manifest cyphers that increase Armor, confuse opponents' senses, or transform themselves into a form that eases all their actions by two steps.    
    
  
> **Intrusions: **   
> The mad scientist produces a gadget or cypher that proves to be the perfect answer to a dilemma at hand.
