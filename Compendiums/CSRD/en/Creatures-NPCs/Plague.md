## Plague  
Plague (often called "Death") is present wherever people die of disease or infirmity brought on by age. She prefers black and pale green evening wear, including long pale green gloves and often a grinning skull mask. When traveling, she drives a pale green hearse or motorcycle, or rides a horse the same sickly green color.

> **Environment: ** Almost anywhere people are dying (but especially of disease and/or old age) and/or with one or more of the Four  
> **Interactions: ** Of all the Four, Plague is the most changeable in outlook, and sometimes is even somewhat sympathetic to humanity's plight. When she's in such a mood, persuasive characters could convince Plague to pass them over, though she promises that it's only a temporary stay of death.  
> **Uses: **The characters find a before-times bunker filled with corpses killed by some strange infection, plus a living "human" wearing a black and pale green evening gown.

> **Combat:** 
> When she wishes, Plague wields a scythe, as if she had always been holding it. She attacks twice with it as her action. On a hit, the scythe deals damage and the target must succeed on a Might defense roll. On a failed roll, the target contracts a supernatural disease requiring that they succeed on a Might defense roll each minute or descend one step on the damage track. If an affected target succeeds on three Might defense rolls at any point, they recover. If Plague removes a glove as an action, she can use her next action to imbue her scythe with necrotic power, or simply touch a target with her bare hand. On a hit with either her touch or the imbued scythe, she inflicts damage, and the target must succeed on a Might defense roll or die. Plague can use this ability about once a day, or immediately again if her previous target dies because of it. As one of the Four, Plague can see in the dark, regains 1 health each round, and, if killed, reappears within 1d10 days at the next nearest location that previously experienced death by disease or due to old age.
