## Internet D@emon   
Weird apps and viruses are a frequent problem on internet-enabled devices, even more so when magic is brought into the mix. Internet d@emons are semi-sentient bits of code that live in computers and smart devices. Initially created to be harmless or even helpful (fulfilling a simple purpose such as converting files, refining data searches, or anonymizing an IP address), they’ve become aggressive and malicious, either deliberately created to cause harm or bucking the constraints of their original code to evolve and multiply. Unsuspecting sorcerers might grab a magical app that promises quicker access to difficult spells or insight on the next big crypto drop, accidentally infecting their devices with a dangerous techno-magical creature.   
  
Most magicians draw the attention of an internet d@emon by using malware cypher apps like EasyMagic.   
  
Internet d@emons have grown beyond their original programming and function like creatures rather than simple software— essentially, they’re a sort of magical limited artificial intelligence. They’re immune to abilities that only affect non-sentient programs.   
  
Some magicians have tried partnering with a d@emon, allowing it to feed on their magic in exchange for a daily magic-enhancing cypher, but the d@emon’s hunger usually grows too strong for it to resist taking more magic than the character planned for.

> **Damage :** 3 points    
> **Armor :** 1  
> **Movement :** Short; travels through the internet at nearly instantaneous speed

> **Environment: ** Computers, smart devices, and areas with strong wireless internet access  
   
> **Uses: **: An internet d@emon usually starts out as an innocuous app subtly draining magic, then switches to an active, aggressive mode when discovered or if starved.   
  
> **Loot: ** A destroyed internet d@emon’s physical form leaves behind a lace-like fragment of magical energy that functions as a meditation aid cypher.  
  
  
> **Combat:**   
>A d@emon outside of an internet‑connected device attacks by siphoning magic from a creature within short range, inflicting 3 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor). However, usually the d@emon prefers to remain hidden within a computer or smart device, slowly and gently draining magic from a nearby creature without being noticed.   
>  
>When a magic-capable creature uses a ten‑minute, one-hour, or ten-hour recovery roll within immediate range of a device with an internet d@emon, subtract 1 from the result of the recovery roll. Over time, the d@emon’s siphoning power strengthens, increasing to 2 or even 3 points taken from every recovery roll. An affected creature can attempt a perception task against the d@emon’s stealth modifier to realize that something is tapping into their magic.   
>  
>If the character discovers which app or device the d@emon is associated with, deleting the app or destroying the device forces the d@emon to either flee through the internet (requiring its action for one to three rounds, depending on local transmission speeds) or immediately manifest in its visible physical form. If manifested, a d@emon attempts to feed on the weakest foe in the area, and once it is sated it leaves the area (breaking off combat if possible) to find a high-speed wireless internet connection so it can transmit itself far away in search of another victim.  
>  
>Once per day, an internet d@emon can create a malware magical app cypher (such as EasyMagic.app), placing it in an app store (physical or online) or sending out a burst of emails with a link to where the app can be downloaded.   
  
  
> **Interaction:**   
>  D@emons are persistent and reasonably clever. They can be bargained with or bribed, but they tend to be greedy and would rather hide or pretend to leave than make a deal.
