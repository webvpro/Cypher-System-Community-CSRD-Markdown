## Redivus  
Redivi spend most of their lives-uncounted millennia-hurtling through space. Most never encounter anything, but some few impact other worlds, are captured by alien spacecraft, or otherwise intercepted. Their traveling form resembles rocky space rubble the size of a small spacecraft-until they unfurl glowing magnetic plasma wings, revealing themselves as strange creatures of living mineral. Redivi can interact with almost any electronic system and manipulate electromagnetic fields. Redivi are searchers, all sent forth by the Great Mother, billions upon billions of them (they say), looking for the seed of the next great cosmic expansion. Thus, most redivi are consumed with finding out more, finding other redivi, and eventually, finding their "universal seed."

> **Damage :** 5 points  
> **Armor :** 4  
> **Movement :** Flies (magnetically levitates) a short distance each round  
> **Environment: ** Almost anywhere, searching  
> **Interactions: ** If any kind of radio or similar communication is in use, these creatures can commandeer it and speak through it, learning a new language seemingly over the course of minutes. Redivi will cooperate with reasonable requests and negotiate, especially if there's a chance they'll find out something new.  
> **Uses: **A redivi pod smashes into the side of the spacecraft, and might at first seem like some kind of attack or boarding action of something truly terrible.  
> **Loot: **NA  
> **GM Intrusion: ** A redivi pod smashes into the side of the spacecraft, and might at first seem like some kind of attack or boarding action of something truly terrible.  

> **Combat:** 
> The stone carapace of a redivus makes a huge "club" when it rams into foes. However, it can also control metal within short range, causing it to flex, animate, crush, or smash. For instance, targets wearing metal space suits are in trouble when that metal begins to unravel. Alternatively, a redivus can use nearby metal to wrap around a target and constrict it, inflicting 5 points of damage (ignores Armor) each round until the target can escape.  
  

> **Intrusions: ** 
> The character's metal- containing equipment is stripped away, then used as ammunition against that PC or an ally.
