## Necromancer  
The ability to influence, command, and call up the dead is an impressive power, given how many more people are dead than living. Since the only thing separating a living person from a dead one is a well-aimed knife or death spell, the number of dead always rises.

> **Environment: ** In places where dead are interred, usually with some number of undead servitors  
> **Interactions: ** Necromancers are feared for their nonchalant attitudes toward life, especially the life of normal people (such as peasants and city folk). They will negotiate but usually don't have the capacity to care about another person's well-being; they're sociopathic.  
> **Uses: **A character has died, and their allies must find a necromancer to help retrieve their spirit. Of course, the necromancer wants something in return for this aid-perhaps an artifact pilfered from whatever underworld or hell the dead character is imprisoned within.  
> **Loot: **Necromancers have one or two expensive items, a cypher, and possibly an artifact.  
> **GM Intrusion: ** A character has died, and their allies must find a necromancer to help retrieve their spirit. Of course, the necromancer wants something in return for this aid-perhaps an artifact pilfered from whatever underworld or hell the dead character is imprisoned within.  

> **Combat:** 
> Necromancers can blast a foe within long range with the cold of the grave or flesh-decaying magic. 
A necromancer can cast a death spell on a foe within short range once every minute; the victim must succeed on a Might defense roll or move down one step on the damage track. This ability could be an innate power or come from an artifact. 
A necromancer who isn't already accompanied by undead spirits or shambling, spirit-inhabited corpses under their command can call up a spirit as an action. A necromancer can command up to five spirits (or newly allied undead, as described below) at a time. 
A necromancer can attempt to take command of a spirit or undead creature within short range. They automatically succeed against an unaligned undead target of level 4 or less. If a targeted spirit is already allied with or in service to a PC, the PC must succeed on an Intellect defense roll or lose control of the spirit to the necromancer's will for one minute. 
	Spirit: level 3; flesh-decaying touch inflicts 3 points of damage  
  

> **Intrusions: ** 
> A bony hand erupts from the ground at the character's feet. On a failed Speed defense roll, they are held in place until they can succeed on a Might task to escape. Each round the character fails to escape, the hand squeezes them for 3 points of damage.
