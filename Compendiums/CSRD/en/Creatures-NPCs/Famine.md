## Famine  
Famine delighted in economic collapse and starvation before the apocalypse. They still spend time destabilizing survivor groups' livelihoods by direct and indirect means. Famine is rail thin, and carries a chain weapon with weighted, disc shaped ends that can also be used as an improvised scale.

> **Combat:** 
> Famine attacks foes with their chain weapon, attacking up to two targets within immediate range at once, or a single target within short range. On a hit, they inflict damage and can choose to entangle one target, who is held helpless on a failed Might defense roll until they escape. Entangled targets automatically take damage each round from the tightening chains. Alternatively, Famine can release a pulse of decay once every few hours that affects all creatures and food stores within short range. Food automatically goes bad, losing all nutritional value. Living targets in the area that fail a Might defense roll feel an overwhelming pang of hunger and descend one step on the damage track. As one of the Four, Famine can see in the dark, regains 1 health each round, and, if killed, reappears within 1d10 days at the next nearest location that previously experienced death through starvation or other privation.
