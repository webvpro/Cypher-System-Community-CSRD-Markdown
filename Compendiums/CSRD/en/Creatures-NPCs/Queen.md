## Queen  
Ah, the Evil Queen. Ruler of the land, watcher in the mirror. Full of magic, utterly merciless, and sharp of tongue. Evil and wicked queens abound in fairy tales, from those who have no names and are remembered only for their evil deeds, to those whose names will never be forgotten: Queen Grimhilde, Maleficent, the Queen of Hearts, and the White Witch. These queens seek power for power's sake, not caring what destruction lies in their wake.
Of course, not all queens are evil--just the ones you hear about most often. But they are all powerful in their own way, even if they are forced to hide it by their circumstances. While they too crave power, they seek it in order to protect their lands, their people, and their loved ones.

> Queens almost always carry an artifact of great power, such as a staff, crown,
mirror, or sword, that grants them unique abilities and skills.
Queens often have familiars, such as ravens, who fight for or beside them. Most familiars can do 4 points of damage with an attack.
Some queens may also be witches or fey creatures, and thus have the ability to use one or two spells and curses that witches and fey also use.
