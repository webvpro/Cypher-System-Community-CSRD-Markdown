## Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Famine   
  
Famine delighted in economic collapse and starvation before the apocalypse. They still spend time destabilizing survivor groups’ livelihoods by direct and indirect means. Famine is rail thin, and carries a chain weapon with weighted, disc shaped ends that can also be used as an improvised scale.
  
>**Motive:** Starve the living; destabilize organized groups  
  
>**Environment:** Almost anywhere people are starving and/or with one or more of the Four
  
>**Health:** 24  
  
>Damage Inflicted: 6 points  
  
>**Armor:** 1  
  
>**Movement: Short;** usually has a black mount or vehicle nearby  
  
>Modifications: Intellect defense as level 8  
  
>**Combat:** Famine attacks foes with their chain weapon, attacking up to two targets within immediate range at once, or a single target within short range. On a hit, they inflict damage and can choose to entangle one target, who is held helpless on a failed Might defense roll until they escape. Entangled targets automatically take damage each round from the tightening chains. Alternatively, Famine can release a pulse of decay once every few hours that affects all creatures and food stores within short range. Food automatically goes bad, losing all nutritional value. Living targets in the area that fail a Might defense roll feel an overwhelming pang of hunger and descend one step on the damage track. As one of the Four, Famine can see in the dark, regains 1 health each round, and, if killed, reappears within 1d10 days at the next nearest location that previously experienced death through starvation or other privation.

>**Interaction:** Famine is keen to talk about delicacies of every kind, becoming more animated and descriptive about mouthwatering foods and drinks the hungrier those nearby are.
  
>**Use:** The characters are trying to help a group of survivors transport much‑needed food stores to their community when someone all in black on a black motorcycle appears on the road ahead.
