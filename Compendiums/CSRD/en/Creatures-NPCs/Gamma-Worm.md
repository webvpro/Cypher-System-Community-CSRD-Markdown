## Gamma Worm    
Gamma worms hide their large forms by burrowing beneath the ground, and when they emerge on the surface, they cloak themselves behind psychic distortion fields. The only clue someone has that they're being stalked is a smell of cloves over the stale whiff of death. Unfortunately, if someone smells a gamma worm's distinctive odor, it's probably already too late.   
Gamma worms might be the result of military research, radioactive mutation, or aliens or other strange intruders seeking to eradicate human life as part of their terraforming efforts to change Earth to their liking.  
Motive: Hunger for flesh; eliminate humans   
Environment: Almost anywhere   
Health: 18   
Damage Inflicted: 6 points   
Armor: 2 (immune to radiation)   
Movement: Short; short when burrowing   
Modifications: Stealth as level 8 when psychic field active; Speed defense as level 5 due to size; ability to see through tricks as level 4   
Combat: Gamma worms attack twice each round with blades they unfold from their wormlike lengths. Alternatively, about once each hour a gamma worm can unleash a hail of gamma spikes against up to three targets within short range. Targets struck by the spikes take damage and must succeed on a Might defense roll or fall unconscious. Unconscious targets wake up a few rounds later feeling dizzy and slightly sick to their stomach--they've developed radiation sickness.   
Gamma worms can use their action to generate a psychic field that effectively grants them invisibility. The invisibility lasts until they attack or move more than an immediate distance on their turn.   
Gamma worms are vulnerable to cold; in chilly conditions, their Speed defense is hindered by four steps. In addition, cold attacks ignore their Armor.   
Interaction: Gamma worms act like prey driven monsters, but they may have a secret language and purpose (if aliens placed them on Earth to hasten the apocalypse or kill survivors in the post apocalyptic world).   
Use: Irradiated and hungry gamma worms emerge from the ruins to hunt fresh meat in outlying communities.  
  
GLOWING ROACH 2 (6)  
Radiation born mutant roaches are terrible individually, but absolutely horrible in swarms. Many times the size of roaches in the before times, these firefly like creatures prefer dark areas, such as ruined subways and abandoned basements.   
Some swarms are rumored to have an insidious group intelligence, one that is utterly inimical to humankind.

> **Environment: ** Anywhere dark, usually in nests of four to ten (or more)    
> **Interactions: ** Glowing roaches almost always react like voracious insects, despite their size. That is, except for swarms of ten or more, which act like sapient creatures. Sapient swarms may try to lure survivors, possibly even spelling out human readable letters in the sand that anonymously ask for help or promise it. But it's a ruse; they despise humans for all the ways people used to exterminate roaches in the before times.

> **Combat:**   
> A glowing roach attacks with radioactive mandibles. When four glowing roaches act together, they can make a single attack as a level 4 creature inflicting 4 points of damage. Targets damaged by a group of glowing roaches must also succeed on a difficulty 4 Might defense task or face additional consequences from the effects of radiation and slashing mandibles, as determined on the Glowing Roach Effects table. The effects are cumulative and last until a target makes a recovery roll.   
Sometimes a single glowing roach mutates further, allowing it to grow into a 20 foot (6 m) long monstrosity. Thankfully, these monstrous glowing roaches are rare and seldom come out into the light.   
Roaches dislike bright illumination: in sunlight or other bright light, glowing roach attacks are hindered.   
*Monstrous glowing roach: level 5, Speed defense as level 4; Armor 2; mandible attack inflicts 7 damage and results in a check on the Glowing Roach Effects table
