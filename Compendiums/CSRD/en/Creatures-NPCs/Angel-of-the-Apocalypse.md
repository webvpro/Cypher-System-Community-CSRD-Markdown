## Angel of the Apocalypse  
If the End Times causes civilization to fall, biblical threats multiply across the land, including one or more angels of the apocalypse. They are every bit as terrifying as the Four Horsemen because they're charged with bringing about the end of the world. They have little room for pity or the plights of individuals; they have nations to topple and the forces of Hell to oppose. 
Angels of the apocalypse radiate a halo of golden white light. Their 10 foot (3.5 m) tall forms--caparisoned for war--are somewhat humanoid, though each has one or more sets of wings. Apocalypse angels also wield an implement that seems to be equal parts trumpet and sword, which they can sound to bring about terrible events, or swing to slay those who oppose them.

> **Interactions: ** Wrapped in purpose, an angel of the apocalypse may ignore entreaties or, if one deigns to respond, tell supplicants to ready themselves for judgment. However, if someone manages to convince an angel to take notice due to their persuasion skill and/or the importance of their need, the angel may give that character aid in the form of healing or direct help immediately or at some promised future date.

An angel's halo momentarily brightens with unbearable psychic energy as combat begins; foes within short range are stunned for one minute if they fail an Intellect defense roll, or until they succeed on an Intellect defense task on their turn to end the effect early. A success means that creature becomes immune to the halo's overwhelming effect. 
The angel can blow their trumpet as their action, creating a blast of sound and energy that sweeps out in all directions to a long distance, inflicting 8 points of damage to all creatures that hear it who fail a Might defense roll, and 2 points even with a successful roll. Structures in the area descend one step on the object damage track. Once they blow their trumpet, they usually can't blow it again for several rounds.
