## Minotaur, The  
The most famous minotaur is the Minotaur, the singular beast from which all lesser minotaur myths descend. The product of a god-cursed union between human and bull,
the Minotaur is monstrous, and only the flesh of people can nourish it. It is usually lost
in a labyrinth created to contain it. But it occasionally gets free to hunt the wider world before the labyrinth pulls it back. Some demigods claim to have slain the Minotaur, but the Minotaur always returns.

on a successful attack. If the Minotaur charges a short distance, it can attack as part of
the same action and inflict an additional 5 points of damage.
The Minotaur is trapped by the labyrinth, but also part of it. Whenever a character attacks
the Minotaur, they must succeed on an Intellect defense task or be claimed by the labyrinth themselves until they can escape with a successful difficulty 7 Intellect task. Those claimed by the labyrinth seem to disappear and find themselves wandering a dark maze. Once a character successfully escapes, they are no longer subject to being claimed by the labyrinth for several days.
If killed, the Minotaur's body is claimed by the labyrinth. Thirty-three days later, the Minotaur is resuscitated.
