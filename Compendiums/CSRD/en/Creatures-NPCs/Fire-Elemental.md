## Fire Elemental  
Searing flame in a vaguely humanoid shape, a fire elemental exists only to burn that which is not already ash. They sometimes spin into being where great conflagrations burn.

> **Environment: ** Anywhere fires can burn  
> **Interactions: ** Fire elementals are barely sapient and usually respond only to those who know spells able to command them. However, there's a chance (about 10%) that a fire elemental commanded to accomplish a particular task breaks free and instead burns whatever's around until it exhausts all possible fuel sources.

> **Combat:** 
> A fire elemental attacks with a flaming limb. The more the elemental burns foes, the more powerful it grows. Its power increases according to the number of successful attacks (that dealt fire damage) it made on another creature during the previous minute.
0 successful attacks: deals 4 points of damage; attacks as level 4
1 successful attack: deals 5 points of damage; attacks as level 5
3 successful attacks: deals 6 points of damage; attacks as level 6
4+ successful attacks: deals 7 points of damage; attacks as level 7
If a fire elemental hasn't burned a foe within the last minute, its combat stats drop back to its level 4 baseline.
A fire elemental is immune to fire attacks but vulnerable to cold; every time it takes 1 point of cold damage, it takes 1 additional point of damage.  
  

> **Intrusions: ** 
> A character hit by the fire elemental's attack catches on fire and takes 3 points of damage each round until they use an action patting, rolling, or smothering the flames.
