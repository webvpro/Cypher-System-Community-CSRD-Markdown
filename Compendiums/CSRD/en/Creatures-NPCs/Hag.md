## Hag  
Hags are evil magical creatures distantly related to the fey. They resemble withered ancient humans with obvious inhuman features-dead eyes, green or purple skin, metal teeth, webbed fingers, and seaweed-like hair are common traits. They love corrupting pure and innocent things, and feast on the dreams and flesh of their victims.

> **Environment: ** Forests, swamps, mountains, and unpleasant natural locations  
> **Interactions: ** Hags are evil, greedy, hateful, and cruel. They rarely do things for others unless they benefit in some way, and they like to trick fools into dangerous tasks that end up profiting the hag instead of anyone else. If shown proper respect and bribed or paid, a hag can be a valuable source of lore.  
> **Uses: **The smell of cakes lures children to a mysterious woodland shack. The hag of the swamp is said to kill anyone who enters their territory without carrying a specific gift.  
> **Loot: **In addition to coins and jewels, a hag usually has several scrolls or potions and may have an artifact.  
> **GM Intrusion: ** The smell of cakes lures children to a mysterious woodland shack. The hag of the swamp is said to kill anyone who enters their territory without carrying a specific gift.  

> **Combat:** 
> Hags can attack with their iron-hard claws and teeth, but often rely on their magic abilities in combat. Hags can breathe water, and usually have three or more of the following abilities: 
* Arcane blast: Use magical energy to blast one foe within short range and inflict 6 points of damage, or divide this energy (and damage) among several foes as the hag sees fit (each foe makes their own Speed defense roll against this attack). 
* Change shape: Transform into a humanoid or common animal, or return to their own form. 
* Curse: Curse a creature within long range, hindering all physical actions by two steps. 
* Fear: Terrify all creatures within short range who look upon them, causing the creatures to flee for one minute if they fail an Intellect defense roll. 
* Illusion: Create an illusion affecting a small area that includes light, sound, and smell. They can use this to disguise themselves as any humanoid creature (such as a human, dwarf, or elf). Changing or maintaining the illusion is not an action. 
* Invisibility: Turn invisible for ten minutes. When invisible, they are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. 
* Murderous glare: Glare at one opponent, causing bloody wounds that inflict 6 points of damage if the creature is within short range (3 points if within long range). 
* Question: Get an answer to a very simple, general question about a creature or place within 1 mile (1.5 km). 
* Scrying eye: View any familiar location within 1 mile as if they were observing it directly. 
* Sleep: Make a creature fall asleep for one minute. Damage or loud noises will wake the creature. 
Three or more allied hags form a coven, which allows them to use each other's magical abilities, and usually grants the coven (when working together) one or two additional abilities.  
  

> **Intrusions: ** 
> A creature becomes afraid and reluctant to oppose the hag, hindering all actions against the hag by two steps for one day.
