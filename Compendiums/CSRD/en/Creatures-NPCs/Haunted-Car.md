## Haunted Car  
Whether you call them haunted, possessed, misenchanted, cursed, or just plain evil, some cars develop a hateful will, the ability to drive themselves, and a love for the smell of blood on asphalt. 

A haunted car makes a bond with a chosen driver—usually someone with a similarly evil nature, or a meek person the car can influence and control. Over time, the driver might physically transform due to the car’s influence, becoming more attractive, confident, and cruel. The car is jealous of anyone interested in its chosen driver, either pushing the driver to turn them away or hunting them down on its own. 

A haunted car has an empathic connection with its chosen driver, conveying simple emotions and desires when within short range. It otherwise is limited to whatever it can play on its radio, using snippets of songs (typically from the era it was made) as threats or taunts toward its next victims. 

A haunted car lets itself be driven by its chosen driver, but it is capable of driving itself with great skill and can operate any moveable part of itself (doors, locks, trunk, and so on).

>Chosen driver: level 2, social interaction as level 1, driving and repairs as level 3 A chosen driver trained or indoctrinated by a haunted car might develop abilities similar to the [[Drives-Like-a-Maniac|Drives Like a Maniac]] focus or, if they can use magic, the  [[Is-A-Car-Wizard|Is A Car Wizard]] focus.

> **Motive:** Violence and vengeance  

> **Modifications**  
>- Speed defense as level 4 due to size

> **Environment: ** Anywhere cars can go 
 
> **Uses: ** Haunted cars go looking for trouble or to hurt those who harmed them or their driver. 

> **Loot: ** A haunted car created by magic might have a few strange bits that can be used as magical cyphers. Otherwise, it’s worth whatever cash a chop shop or junkyard will pay for it—assuming that won’t just spread its malice to other vehicles

> **Combat:** 
>A haunted car attacks by colliding with or running over a foe, inflicting 6 points of damage. If the car does nothing but move at least a short distance on its turn, its attack in the next round is eased and inflicts an additional 5 points of damage. If a foe is within it, the car moves its interior parts (seats, seat belts, and so on) to crush and choke them, tries to force them out with an open door and a hard turn, or (if all else fails) crashes in an attempt to eject the passenger through the windshield. 
>
>A haunted car can drive itself a long distance each round and still take another action (such as attacking). Most can reach an overland speed of up to 100 miles per hour (160 kph). 
>
>A haunted car with at least 1 health recovers a few points of health every hour. The chosen driver can double this rate by actively repairing the car. 


> **Interaction:** 
> A haunted car doesn’t converse or bargain. It lurks, using engine noises and evocative songs from its radio to intimidate and threaten anyone it wants to kill.
