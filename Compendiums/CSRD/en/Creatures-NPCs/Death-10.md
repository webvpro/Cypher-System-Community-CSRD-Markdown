## Death 10 (infinite)
Death goes by many names, takes many forms, and has only one purpose: to make all equal in the end. Death is often an unwanted visitor—taking the life of someone who is not ready to go—but just as often, they come to those who are ready. To them, Death is a most welcome, the most welcome, guest of all.

While some see Death as evil, they are not inherently so, no more than the cougar hunting the hare for dinner. In fact, they are the great equalizer, raising paupers to kings and kings to common people.

Death is ancient, but not old. Wise, but not all-knowing. Brilliant, but not perfect. Death is also, very often, bored. They have seen everything, heard everything, and done everything that it is possible for an immortal being to do, and some days they feel sure they will never experience anything new or interesting again. But still, they try, taking on new guises, hiding themselves away, even traveling to distant stars and moons before their duties and obligations once again pull them to return.
>If Death appears at the foot of a person’s bed, that person can recover if the proper steps are taken. If Death is at the head of the bed, almost nothing can be done to save the victim, beyond an impossible bargain.

>**Motive:** To do their duty and make everyone equal
>**Environment:** Everywhere and anywhere
>**Health:** ∞
>**Damage Inflicted:** Death
>**Armor:** Immune to all harm
>**Movement:** Variable depending on their form, but Death can move instantaneously almost anywhere that they desire
>**Modifications:** Seeing through trickery, deception, or bargaining as level 8
>
>**Combat:** Death kills. They kill any number of ways, depending on their mood, what’s at hand, and how they believe the person should leave their life. Thankfully, death only comes for someone when their time is up. 
>
>Still, it’s not considered wise to provoke or challenge Death to physical combat, for there is only one outcome: a single attack from Death kills the victim (except in the rare case where the victim has protection against death, such as with one of Death’s candles).
>
>**Interaction:** Death cannot be hurt and cannot be killed, but they can be bargained with, bet against, and sometimes tricked. More rarely, they have even been known to lose a bargain or be captured for a short period of time.
>
>**Use:** Bargaining with Death is a potential way to achieve an impossible task or gain a very rare item, but of course it always comes with a price (usually an earlier death for the bargainer or someone else). Death is always looking for something interesting going on, and may appear just to spend time with the characters if they’re engaged in an intriguing activity.
>
>**GM intrusion:** Death mistakes a character for someone else.
