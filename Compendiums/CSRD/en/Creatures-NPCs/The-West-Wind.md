## The West Wind  
The West Wind has no master, no shackles, no chains. She goes where she will, and woe to those who try to capture or hold her. When she's not blowing through the sky, she takes the shape of a human woman dressed in a sparkling blue tuxedo, her short silver hair pushed back from her face.
	Not all winds are living creatures. Sometimes the wind is just the wind. But you won't know which is which until you try to talk with it.

> **Interactions: ** Some say the West Wind is cold, but she's really just an introvert and prefers to spend most of her time traveling alone. However, she's actually very warm hearted and is likely to help those in need. She does not respond well to trickery, traps, or attempts to force her hand (unless they're terribly clever or smart, and then she admits grudging respect for the perpetrators).
