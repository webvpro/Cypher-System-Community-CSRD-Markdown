## Four Hoursemen of the Apocalypse Beast  
Beast (also called "Conquest") is present at mass shootings and acts of genocide. He is adroit at spreading misinformation and, prior to the apocalypse, was often seen on various "newstainment" shows and conspiracy theory websites, spreading lies under an alias. Then and now, he appears in a white suit, accessorized with white shades and gloves. His hair is white, too.

> **Interactions: ** Beast comes across as a kind truth teller, someone "just asking questions," but it doesn't take long for perceptive people to realize he's a consummate, continual gaslighter, always working to manipulate others.  
> **Uses: **A sniper on the ridge tries to pick the PCs off as they pass across a bridge. Behind the sniper stands a man in white.

> **Combat:** 
> Beast prefers that others fight in his stead. Those convinced of his lies ease their attacks and defenses, and deal 2 additional points of damage with a successful attack. If forced into conflict, Beast produces a handgun, making two long range attacks as his action. The first time any target is hit by Beast in combat, that target takes damage and must succeed on an Intellect defense roll. A failed roll means the target mistakenly believes one of their allies attacked them instead of Beast. The target gets a new Intellect defense roll each round to realize their error. 
As one of the Four, Beast can see in the dark, regains 1 health each round, and, if killed, reappears within 1d10 days at the next nearest location that previously experienced a mass shooting or genocidal act.
