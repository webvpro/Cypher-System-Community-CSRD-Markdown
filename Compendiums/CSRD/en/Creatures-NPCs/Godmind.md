## Godmind  
Unfathomably powerful post-singularity AIs, godminds are vast, having used the matter of an entire solar system and all its planets to create an immense brain, weave themselves into a nebula, or encode themselves into quantum strings of existence light-years across. When necessary, a godmind forms a nexus of consciousness-an instance-appearing as a disembodied eye of electromagnetic energy, ranging from about the size of a human eye all the way up to the size of a planet.  

  
> **Level :** 10  
> **Health :** 50  
> **Damage :** 15 points  
> **Armor :** 0  
> **Movement :** Very long when flying  
> **Environment: ** Anywhere, usually in space  
> **Interactions: ** To actually get a godmind's attention and negotiate could require ancient command code, finding an old input device, or showing up with a relic from an ancient ultra or other prize. If a godmind does render aid, it's likely to be in a form that is initially enigmatic, though ultimately extremely powerful.  
> **Uses: **A universal threat requires a defense that is equally potent. Research suggests that the diffuse nebula known as the Double Helix may actually be the visible form of a vast godmind. Perhaps it can help.  
> **Loot: **Sometimes a godmind provides powerful artifacts to aid those who petition them for aid, assuming the need is dire.  
> **GM Intrusion: ** A universal threat requires a defense that is equally potent. Research suggests that the diffuse nebula known as the Double Helix may actually be the visible form of a vast godmind. Perhaps it can help.  

> **Combat:** 
> A godmind can vary the physical laws of the universe within a light-second of one of its instances (some would call them avatars) to create an effect most useful to the godmind at the time. For instance, a godmind could create a gamma ray burst inflicting 15 points of damage on all creatures within very long range, attempt to put a target into temporal stasis, send a target (even a target as large as spacecraft) through a temporary wormhole gate, and so on. It could also scan the memory banks of any digital machine, and possibly of any living creatures. In any event, if an instance were targeted, and successfully neutralized or even destroyed, the godmind itself isn't harmed. An aggressor would have to find the godmind's primeval "computer core" to destroy one, likely an epic quest in and of itself.  
  

> **Intrusions: ** 
> The godmind rewinds time a few seconds and sidesteps whatever negative effect would have otherwise inconvenienced it.
