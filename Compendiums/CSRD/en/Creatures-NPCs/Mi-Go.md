## Mi-Go  
These extraterrestrial creatures are known as the Fungi from Yuggoth or the Abominable Ones. They are a bizarre amalgam of insect and fungal entity, with many limbs and wings that can carry them aloft. They sometimes enslave humans to work for them in strange factories, mines, or other
labor-intensive capacities.

> **Environment: ** Usually cold or temperate hills or mountains  
> **Interactions: ** Although very few mi-go speak human languages, peaceful interaction with these creatures is not impossible. It's just very difficult (level 7), as they see most humans as little more than animals.  
> **Uses: **The characters are attacked by mi-go intent on capturing and enslaving them. If caught, the PCs are sent to scavenge through primordial ruins for disturbing technological relics.  
> **Loot: **Mi-go always have 1d6 cyphers as well as many curious objects that have no obvious human function.  
> **GM Intrusion: ** The characters are attacked by mi-go intent on capturing and enslaving them. If caught, the PCs are sent to scavenge through primordial ruins for disturbing technological relics.  

> **Combat:** 
> Mi-go defend themselves with pincers and claws but are more likely to use technological devices as weapons. Assume that a mi-go has one of the following abilities from a device:
Project a blast of electricity at long range that inflicts 6 points of damage
Emit poison gas in a cloud that fills to short range and inflicts 4 points of Intellect damage if the victim fails a Might defense roll (the mi-go is immune)
Project a holographic image of itself to one side that hinders attacks aimed at the real mi-go by two steps
Project a sonic field that provides +2 to Armor
Mi-go have access to other devices as well, including translators, cylinders that can preserve a human's brain without its body, sophisticated tools, collars that control the actions of their wearers, and weird vehicles. Mi-go suffer no damage from cold and do not need to breathe.  
  

> **Intrusions: ** 
> Fungal spores from the mi-go's body overcome the character, who must succeed at a Might defense roll or lose their next turn. The character faces this risk each round they are within immediate distance of the creature.
