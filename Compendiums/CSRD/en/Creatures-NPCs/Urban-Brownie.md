## Urban Brownie  
While most people are familiar with rural brownies with their wizened, ragged appearance and their penchant for helping with farming tasks, the urban brownie is a very different type of entity. Having adapted to live in cities and decent-sized towns, urban brownies tend to care much more about their appearance and prefer less outdoorsy forms of labor.   
  
Most are natty dressers, often altering the clothing of large dolls or young children to create well-heeled outfits for themselves. They prefer to have their own private spaces in people’s homes or businesses, but will inhabit small shelters or niches if they can’t find any other home. Many live in coffee shops, finding the offerings of caffeine and pastries well worth the tasks they perform in thanks (usually cleaning, making elegantly lettered signs, and organizing cupboards). They’re most active in the evenings and overnight, but some choose to acclimate to the rhythm of the city they live in and can be seen during the day.   
  
A brownie who feels insulted, disrespected, or unappreciated will quickly become malicious and spread word about whoever treated them so poorly.

> **Damage :** 3 or 6 points (see below)   
> **Armor :** 0   
> **Movement :** Short  
> **Motive:**  Comfort and security   
  
> **Modifications**    
>- Speed defense and movement as level 4 due to size and quickness  
>- Perception, riddles, and tricks as level 4   
  
    
> **Environment: ** Anywhere their fictional self would feel comfortable   
   
> **Uses: **: Brownies are usually supportive characters in a story, but they may be vexing tricksters—or even outright antagonists if living in a home where the primary foe (or a player character) mistreats them. They’re usually overlooked by nonmagical people, so they often witness secret events and have interesting information.  
> >Rural brownies have the same stats as urban brownies. The differences between them are mostly in appearance and personality, as rural brownies tend to dress in rags, prefer to work at night, and are not opposed to doing manual labor outdoors in all manner of weather—provided they’re well-rewarded.  
  
  
> **Loot: ** NA  
> **Combat:**   
>Brownies are tricksters through and through, and nearly all their abilities fall into this category.   
>  
>**Mend:** Spend two rounds mending something that is broken (up to level 5). The item works for two rounds before it returns to its broken state. (This ability does not work on used cyphers or depleted artifacts.)   
>  
>**Needle and Thread:** Magically sew a creature’s clothing, shoes, accessories, or skin to something else, making it difficult for the creature to move. The creature’s actions are hindered until they succeed on a level 3 Might defense roll to break free.   
>  
>**No See Me:** Take the shape of a small object in the vicinity, such as a cookie jar, shoe, or vase. The brownie is indistinguishable from the object, and the effect lasts for one minute or until they take a combat action.   
>  
>**Put That Anywhere:** Move an item within short range in such a way that it trips up and injures a foe, such as slamming a door closed, knocking a rake across a pathway, or dropping a chandelier from the ceiling. The foe takes 3 points of damage and, depending on the circumstances, may be knocked prone if they fail a Might defense roll.   
>  
>**Shine-Shine-Shine:** Spend two rounds making a (willing) person, place, or thing so pretty that it is wonderful to look upon. All foes are unable to look away for one round and lose their next action. All allies are bolstered by the beauty and gain an asset on their next action.  
  
>**Interaction:**   
>Brownies are typically mischievous and tricky, with a love of puns, riddles, and puzzles. They appreciate those who appreciate them and are a bit like crows in that they long-remember the faces of those who have helped or harmed them.
