## Grainne, the Wayward Daughter    
Grainne is the Fairy Queen of Hope and Despair, sometimes also called the Wayward Daughter, the Winter Queen, and Dark One. Grainne is to the dark what Aine is to the light. This doesn't mean that Grainne is evil, just that she represents what is good and bad in the world that is hidden in shadows, buried beneath the ground, and revealed at night. She has her own moral code, one that can work in the favor of those who are cunning and willing to look at the darkness of their own hearts.

> **Combat:**   
> Grainne is a talented combatant, and seems to revel in having a foe who is a  
challenge to her. She carries a dark green crystal staff that emits a dark coil of reddish energy, which inflicts 12 points of damage. Alternatively, she can send out a cloud of black smoke that deals 9 points of damage to all creatures in a short area. She also wears the Tiara of Pailis, a griffin-shaped tiara that allows her to fly. Grainne has a variety of magical abilities at her disposal, including the following:  
Animal Communication: Grainne has a special affinity with badgers and can ask them for help. When she calls them (as an action), a cete of eight large badgers appears. They act as two level 4 creatures; attacked beings must also succeed on an Intellect defense roll or be shapeshifted into a badger for one round.  
Oneirokinesis: Grainne can infiltrate people's dreams to converse with them. As such, she might implant an idea in their heads (such as "I'm going to die tonight" or "I should go back home"). When the character wakes, they must succeed on a level 6 Intellect defense roll to shake the idea. Otherwise, they feel a strong need to act on it, and are hindered in any tasks that go against the idea (this lasts until they make their next recovery roll).  
Shadowmelding: Grainne merges with shadows, making her nearly  
intangible. In this form, she cannot be injured by physical attacks, and her attacks inflict 8 points of Intellect damage on anyone whose body is darkened by her shadow.    
    
  
> **Intrusions: **   
> A character's companion animal or mount is affected by Grainne's animal affinity and falls under her power.
