## Fallen Angel    
Angels are normally associated with virtue and service to higher moral beings. But just like people, sometimes angels are tempted into impure acts. Those who stray too far over the line may fall from higher realms and be forced to walk the Earth in penance. This experience drives most fallen angels insane.  
Fallen angel abilities wax and wane according to the position of the sun. During the day, a fallen angel seems almost sane (and is less dangerous), but at night, it is volatile and threatening to everyone.

> **Environment: ** Anywhere, sometimes living alone in the wilderness, other times walking the hard streets of large cities    
> **Interactions: ** By day, fallen angels are not automatically hostile, and they can be negotiated and reasoned with. They can seem truly angelic, though they are often confused and forgetful of their origin. But when night descends, fallen angels lose control of their faculties as they swell with rage and power. Unless a character directs a fallen angel toward another creature on which it can vent its wrath, the character becomes the object of the fury.    
> **Uses: **A star slips down from the sky and lands in the country. The next day, travelers come upon a farm in the area and find everyone dead and burned. A trail of scorched earth leads up into the hills.    
> **Loot: **Fallen angels collect cyphers and usually have a few.    
> **GM Intrusion: ** A star slips down from the sky and lands in the country. The next day, travelers come upon a farm in the area and find everyone dead and burned. A trail of scorched earth leads up into the hills.    
  
> **Combat:**   
> At night, a fallen angel can attack other creatures by projecting a long-range beam of burning light. Against foes within immediate range, the fallen angel manifests burning wings. A fallen angel can choose to make its attacks ignore Armor, but for each attack so modified, it loses 4 points of health.  
On the rare occasion that a fallen angel is within immediate range of another of its kind, both regain 1 point of health per round.  
By day, a fallen angel cannot project  
long-range attacks and has no visible wings with which to make melee attacks, though it may carry a melee weapon.    
    
  
> **Intrusions: **   
> A fallen angel's successful attack causes the character's cypher to detonate (if a grenade) or otherwise activate in a less-than-ideal fashion.
