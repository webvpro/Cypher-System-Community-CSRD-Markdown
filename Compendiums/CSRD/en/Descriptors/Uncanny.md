## Uncanny    
There's something unusual about you, and it makes other people a little uncomfortable. You know you're exceptional--gifted, even--and being a bit odd doesn't make you any less of a person. This uncanny element is a part of you, in your blood, in your DNA. You can't help it, but you won't apologize for it. You feel comfortable around other people with similar strangeness, people who've experienced the same prejudice that you have; these shared experiences mean they're your family, perhaps the only family you've got.  
### You gain the following characteristics    
> #### Exceptional  
> +2 to your Might Pool and +2 to your Speed Pool.    
  
> #### Distinctive Physical Quirk  
> You have an unusual physical aspect. Depending on the setting, this can vary greatly; it might be something external and obvious, such as an odd smell or blue hair, or internal and hidden, like having blood type "omega." Whatever it is, your quirk draws a lot of attention when it's discovered.    
  
> #### A Sense for the Weird  
> Sometimes--at the GM's discretion--an event or person that seems related to your uncanny nature attracts your attention. You can sense it from afar, and if you get within long range of it, you can sense whether it is overtly dangerous or not.    
  
> #### Skill  
> You're trained in either perception tasks or stealth tasks.    
  
> #### Skill  
> You're trained in one kind of knowledge related to your quirk, such as olfactory science, mutations, or hematology.    
  
> #### Inability  
> People find you unnerving. All tasks relating to pleasant social interaction are hindered. (Other people who are unusual like you aren't affected by this.)
