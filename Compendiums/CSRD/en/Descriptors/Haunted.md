## Haunted  
The world seems more dangerous than it should. You are troubled by fearful and anxious thoughts, and can’t always discern what is a true threat and what isn’t. You might see shadows following you, be plagued by nightmares, or be filled with a general sense of unease. This constant feeling of being haunted drives you to try to make things feel safer for yourself and those around you.
### You gain the following characteristics:
#### Fleeting
>+4 to your Speed Pool.
#### Skill
>You are trained in initiative actions.
#### Skill
>You are trained in sensing danger.
#### Prescient
>You always see danger coming, whether it’s there or not. Once after each ten-hour recovery roll, you can refuse a GM intrusion without spending XP. Alternatively, you can spend 1 XP and work with the GM to turn the intrusion into something positive for your character.

>Anxious thoughts are heavy, and carrying them leaves you feeling emotionally weaker than you’d like. Intellect defense tasks are hindered.
