## Frumious  
SA furious, fuming anger waits, always, just beneath your surface, swirling under your skin like a caged beast. You might do your best to hide it or control it, or perhaps you have given up trying to tame it and you let it run wild. Either way, it seems to cause you—and those around you—grief more often than not.
### You gain the following characteristics:
#### Manxome
>+2 to your Might Pool and +2 to your Speed Pool.
#### Skill
>You are quick to respond to being provoked (or even to the perception that you are being provoked). You are trained in initiative actions (to determine who goes first in combat).
Bandersnatch: You extend the reach of your attack, allowing immediate-range character abilities to reach foes a short distance away, and short-range character abilities to reach foes a long distance away.
Inability: You find it hard to hold your anger back—it seeps through your skin even when you don’t mean it to, causing others to shy away from it. All tasks relating to positive social interactions are hindered.
Inability: Sometimes your anger overrides your good senses, causing you to act before you’ve properly assessed the situation. All tasks relating to perception are hindered.
