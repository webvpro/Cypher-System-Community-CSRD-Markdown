## Mutant  
Savage forces strong enough to destroy a world left you transformed. Either through latent mutations passed down from ancestors that survived the apocalypse, or because something about you reacts when you're exposed to radiation or some other mutagenic source, you are prone to mutation. You might look relatively similar to others of your species, or you might have one or more obvious physical differences that make it hard to disguise your nature. Not that you necessarily want to hide what you are; you might wish to proudly display what makes you different and, to your mind, better.
### You gain the following characteristics  
> #### Significant Mutations
> Choose which option from the following list you'd like for your mutations. Whichever you choose, it is rolled for randomly; you don't select it.  

> #### Distinctive Mutations
> You can choose if you want to have distinctive mutations or not. If you do, choose the number, up to four distinctive mutations, which are rolled for randomly. (If the GM is using the transitory mutations optional rule, you can only choose to have up to three distinctive mutations.)  

> #### Cosmetic Mutations
> You can choose if you want to have cosmetic mutations or not. If you do, choose whether you want one or two cosmetic mutations, which are rolled for randomly. Once all your mutations have been rolled for, work together with the GM to ensure that what's been rolled is a character you want to play.  

### Initial Link to the Starting Adventure  
From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.  
- The other PCs found you in some weird "mutant" chrysalis and pulled you out; you were grateful and joined them.  
- The other PCs were "hunting mutants" but when they found you, they realized they had been misguided.  
- You wanted to get away from a bad situation, so you went with the PCs.  
- The PCs asked you to come along, believing that your particular mutations could be harnessed for the benefit of the mission.
