## Rusted  
Life has dealt you some hard knocks. You lost an eye, an arm, or a leg several years ago, possibly during the apocalypse itself, or perhaps afterward. But you didn't give up. You adjusted, learning to do everything again, despite what first seemed like a limitation. If you lost a limb, you use a prosthetic; if an eye, you sometimes quip that binocular vision is overrated. Sure, there are times when you struggle with discomfort, pain, and possibly even self-consciousness. However, overcoming all that only makes you stronger and more determined to succeed. Ultimately, your scars, your prosthetic (if any), and your story represent who you are: a survivor who overcomes whatever is thrown your way.
### You gain the following characteristics  
> #### Resilient
> +2 to your Might Pool or +2 to your Intellect Pool or +1 to all three Pools.  

> #### Skill
> Hard knocks have toughened you; you are trained in either Might defense tasks or Intellect defense tasks (choose one).  

> #### Skill
> You had to fake it until you made it; you are trained in one creative skill such as singing, writing, acting, composing, public speaking, painting, sculpture, dancing, or something similar.  

> #### Inability
> You've learned to do everything again and, in truth, better than most people ever could. But your injury is real; it's why you sometimes joke that you're "rusted." If you've lost an eye, your perception tasks involving sight are hindered. If you rely on a prosthetic leg, tasks requiring movement are hindered. If you rely on a prosthetic arm, tasks involving using both hands are hindered.  

> #### Additional Equipment
> You have a prosthetic for one arm or one leg, or you have an eyepatch (and prosthetic eye) for a missing eye.  

### Initial Link to the Starting Adventure  
From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.  
- You bragged that there's nothing someone else could do that you couldn't do twice as well, which is how you got involved in your current situation.  
- You're afraid of what might happen if the other PCs fail.  
- You were tailing one of the other PCs for reasons of your own, which brought you into the action.  
- You stepped in to defend one of the PCs when that character was threatened. While talking to them afterward, you heard about the group's task.
