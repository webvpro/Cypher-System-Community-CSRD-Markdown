## Helborn    
Demons of the underworld sometimes escape. When they do, they can taint human bloodlines. Things like you are the result of such unnatural unions. Part human and part something else, you are an orphan of a supernatural dalliance. Thanks to your unsettling appearance, you've probably been forced to make your own way in a world that often fears and resents you. Some of your kin have large horns, tails, and pointed teeth. Others are more subtle or more obvious in their differences-a shadow of a knife-edge in their face and a touch that withers normal plants, a little too much fire in their eyes and a scent of ash in the air, a forked tongue, goatlike legs, or the inability to cast a shadow. Work with the GM on your particular helborn appearance.  
### You gain the following characteristics    
> #### Devious  
> +2 to your Intellect Pool.    
  
> #### Skill  
> You are trained in tasks related to magic lore and lore of the underworld.    
  
> #### Fire Adapted  
> +2 to Armor against damage from fire only.    
  
> #### Helborn Magic  
> You are inherently magical. Choose one low-tier ability from the Abilities chapter. If the GM agrees it is appropriate, you gain that ability as part of your helborn heritage, and can use it like any other type or focus ability.    
  
> #### Inner Evil  
> You sometimes lose control and risk hurting your allies. When you roll a 1, the GM has the option to intrude by indicating that you lose control. Once you've lost control, you attack any and every living creature within short range. You can't spend Intellect points for any reason other than to try to regain control (a difficulty 2 task). After you regain control, you suffer a -1 penalty to all rolls for one hour.    
  
> #### Inability  
> People distrust you. Tasks to persuade or deceive are hindered.    
  
### Initial Link to the Starting Adventure    
From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.    
- You were nearly beaten to death by people who didn't like your look, but the PCs found and revived you.    
- The PCs hired you for your knowledge of magic.    
- Every so often you get visions of people trapped in the underworld. You tracked those people down and found the PCs, who'd never visited the underworld. Yet.    
- Your situation at home became untenable because of how people reacted to your looks. You joined the PCs to get away.
