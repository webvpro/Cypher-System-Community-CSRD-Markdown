## Amazing  
  
You have a knack for surprising people-- performing impossible athletic feats, sneaking up on someone who's alert, or instantly reacting to an ambush. You like to make use of these talents to enhance (or rehabilitate) your reputation as a hero prone to spectacular rescues, defeating foes way above your league, and arriving just in time to save the day. Ironically, in your normal daily life, you're a little awkward and overlooked.
  
### You gain the following characteristics  
  
> #### Exceptional
  
> +2 to your Speed Pool, and 2 additional points to divide among your stat Pools.  
  

  
> #### Skill
  
> You're trained in initiative and stealth tasks.  
  

  
> #### Self-Hype
  
> When you apply a level of Effort to a task, you get a free level of Effort. You can do this one time, although the ability is renewed each time you make a one-hour or ten-hour recovery roll.  
  

  
> #### Inability
  
> Your sudden appearances are startling to regular people. Positive social reactions are hindered (villains and other superheroes aren't affected by this).

- You were tailing someone the other PCs were following and decided to drop in.  
  
- You saw that the other PCs were in a fight and chose to help them out.  
  
- You had a hunch that something big was about to go down.
