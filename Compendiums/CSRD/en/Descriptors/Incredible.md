## Incredible    
You're misunderstood, and you might not even think of yourself as a hero, but somehow you keep ending up in situations where your abilities are just what's needed to prevent disaster. Maybe good luck cancels out just enough of being cursed to count as a win. You've saved innocent lives, defeated some really bad people, and perhaps even cheated death a couple of times. Half the time you don't even know how you did it, but you succeeded at the impossible . . . often with a lot of collateral damage. When you hear police sirens, it's time to leave, but you know that trouble will find you eventually--and you'll be ready to smash it.  
### You gain the following characteristics    
> #### Strong  
> +2 to your Might Pool, and 2 additional points to divide among your stat Pools.    
  
> #### Skill  
> You're trained in breaking things.    
  
> #### Skill  
> You're trained in all jumping tasks.    
  
> #### Inability  
> Your destructive reputation or some other reluctance to communicate makes people distrust you. Any task involving social interaction is hindered.    
  
> #### Incredible Action  
> You can choose to automatically succeed on one task without rolling, as long as the task's difficulty is no higher than 6. When you do so, however, you also trigger a GM intrusion as if you had rolled a 1. The intrusion doesn't invalidate the success, but it probably qualifies it in some fashion. You can do this one time, although the ability renews each time you make a ten-hour recovery roll.    
  
### Initial Link to the Starting Adventure    
From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.    
- One of the other PCs sensed your decent heart and decided to befriend you.    
- You literally crashed through a wall and ended up in the middle of the other PCs.    
- One of the other PCs reminds you of someone from your past.    
- You were feeling lonely and took a risk talking to someone, and so far it's paying off
