## Dragonfolk  
You have scales, fangs, claws, and magic-gifts of the dragons. You might have been born of dragonfolk parents, willingly transformed in a magical ceremony, or chosen by a dragon to be their agent or champion. You have a great destiny before you, but it is your choice whether to make it your own or bend to the will of those who made you what you are. Some people mistrust or fear you, and others consider you a prophet or wish to exploit your power for their own goals.
### You gain the following characteristics  
> #### Sturdy
> +2 to your Might Pool.  

> #### Skill
> You are trained in intimidation  

> #### Dragonbreath (3 Might Points)
> You breathe out a blast of energy in an immediate area. Choose one type of energy (arcane, cold, fire, thorn, and so on); the blast inflicts 2 points of damage of this kind of energy (ignores Armor) to all creatures or objects within the area. Because this is an area attack, adding Effort to increase your damage works differently than it does for single-target attacks. If you apply a level of Effort to increase the damage, add 2 points of damage for each target, and even if you fail your attack roll, all targets in the area still take 1 point of damage. Action.  

> #### Draconic Resistance
> You gain +2 Armor against the type of energy you create with your dragonbreath.  

> #### Scaly
> +1 to Armor.  

> #### Inability
> You have difficulty relating to non-dragons. Tasks to persuade non-dragons are hindered.
