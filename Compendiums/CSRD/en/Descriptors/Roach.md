## Roach    
You are born of a species of evolved insects once called "cockroach," but that is far in the past. Radiation and forced evolution have radically increased your size, shape, and ability to think. Your exoskeleton mimics the shape of a human being, though not perfectly. When you move about human society, shadows and cloaks are your ally if you wish to pass unnoticed. When those of your kind are discovered, it usually goes poorly for someone. You, however, have a wandering spirit and seek to explore the fallen world and find a new way forward.  
### You gain the following characteristics    
> #### Scuttler  
> Your Speed Edge increases by 1.    
  
> #### Sense by Scent  
> You can sense your environment even in total darkness.    
  
> #### Cling  
> You can move an immediate distance each round on walls or clinging to the ceiling.    
  
> #### Carapace  
> +1 to Armor.    
  
> #### Glide  
> You can extend small wings from your carapace that grant an asset in jumping tasks and allow you to fall up to a short distance without taking damage.    
  
> #### Skill  
> You are trained in disguise tasks.    
  
> #### Inability  
> You are susceptible to disease and poison. Defense rolls against disease or poison are hindered.    
  
> #### Inability  
> You mimic a human, but you are not as fierce. Tasks involving combat- including attack and defense rolls-are hindered.    
  
> #### Insect Prejudice  
> While among non-roaches, all positive interaction tasks are hindered.
