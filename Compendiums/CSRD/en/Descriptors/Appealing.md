## Appealing    
You're attractive to others, but perhaps more important, you are likeable and charismatic. You've got that "special something" that draws others to you. You often know just the right thing to say to make someone laugh, put them at ease, or spur them to action. People like you, want to help you, and want to be your friend.  
### You gain the following characteristics    
> #### Charismatic  
> +2 to your Intellect Pool.    
  
> #### Skill  
> You are trained in pleasant social interactions.    
  
> #### Resistant to Charms  
> You're aware of how others can manipulate and charm people, and you notice when those tactics are used on you. Because of this awareness, you are trained in resisting any kind of persuasion or seduction if you wish it.    
  
### Initial Link to the Starting Adventure    
From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.    
- You met a total stranger (one of the other PCs) and charmed them so much that they invited you along.    
- The PCs were looking for someone else, but you convinced them that you were perfect instead.    
- Pure happenstance-because you just go along with the flow of things and everything usually works out.    
- Your charismatic ways helped get one of the PCs out of a difficult spot a long time ago, and they always ask you to join them on new adventures.
