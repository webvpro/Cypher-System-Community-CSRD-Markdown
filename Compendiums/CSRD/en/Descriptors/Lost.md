## Lost    
You can’t remember exactly when it happened or why, but you have lost your way. The path through life, or even through your own mind, no longer seems to exist. Once you had a reason and a goal, but now you find yourself wandering aimlessly, without clear purpose or drive.  
### You gain the following characteristics  
#### Skill  
>You’re trained in three areas of knowledge of your choice.  
#### Skill  
>Being lost has taught you to pay attention to your surroundings. You are trained in perception tasks.  
#### Curiouser  
>You’re rarely surprised by strange circumstances and are able to go with the flow more than most. You can choose to automatically succeed on an initiative task without rolling. You can do  
this one time, although the ability renews each time you make a ten-hour recovery roll.  
#### And Curiouser  
>For being so lost yourself, you are able to help others find things in the world. Anytime you help someone who is searching for a lost object or person, you are able to point them in the right general direction.  
#### Inability: Figuring out how to move through the world is not one of your strongpoints. All tasks involving navigation, map reading, geography, and so on are hindered.  
#### Inability: Sometimes being directionless makes it hard to get moving. You have an inability in noncombat Speed-related tasks, such as climbing, jumping, and running.  
#### Additional Equipment: You carry a broken compass with you. It was a gift from someone you cared about deeply.  
### Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:  
From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.  
1. The PCs came upon you while you were wandering and lost, and invited you to join them.  
2. You happened to be in the right place at the right time.  
3. You wish to find your path again, and you hope that the PCs will help you do that.  
4. The PCs are heading somewhere specific, and it feels good to be surrounded by people who know where they’re going.
