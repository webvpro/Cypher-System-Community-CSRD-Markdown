## Artificially Intelligent    
You are a machine-not just a sentient machine, but a sapient one. Your awareness might make you an exception, or there may be many like you, depending on the setting. Artificially intelligent characters have machine minds of one type or another. This can involve an advanced computer brain, but it could also be a liquid computer, a quantum computer, or a network of smart dust particles creating an ambient intelligence. You might even have been an organic creature whose mind was uploaded into a machine. Your body, of course, is also a machine. Most people refer to you as a robot or an android, although you know neither term describes you very well, as you are as free-willed and free-thinking as they are.  
### You gain the following characteristics    
> #### Superintelligent  
> +4 to your Intellect Pool.    
  
> #### Artificial Body  
> +3 to your Might Pool and your Speed Pool.    
  
> #### Shell  
> +1 to Armor.    
  
> #### Limited Recovery  
> Resting restores points only to your Intellect Pool, not to your Might Pool or your Speed Pool.    
  
> #### Mechanics, Not Medicines  
> Conventional healing methods, including the vast majority of restorative devices and medicines, do not restore points to any of your Pools. You can recover points to your Intellect Pool only by resting, and you can recover points to your Speed and Might Pools only through repair. The difficulty of the repair task is equal to the number of points of damage sustained, to a maximum of 10. Repairing your Might and Speed Pools are always two different tasks.    
  
> #### Machine Vulnerabilities and Invulnerabilities  
> Damaging effects and other threats that rely on an organic system-poison, disease, cell disruption, and so on-have no effect on you. Neither do beneficial drugs or other effects. Conversely, things that normally affect only inorganic or inanimate objects can affect you, as can effects that disrupt machines.    
  
> #### Uncanny Valley  
> You have a hard time relating to organic beings, and they don't react well to you. All positive interaction tasks with such beings are hindered by two steps.
