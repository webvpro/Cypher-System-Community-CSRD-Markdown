## Ghost    
Unfortunately, you’re dead. But hey, it’s not all bad! Your spirit has remained in the mortal world. You can still walk among the living, but you no longer need pesky things like food or sleep. It’s up to you how long you’ve been dead, whether you remember your death, and why you’ve stuck around: seeking revenge, settling a debt, protecting your descendants, perfecting your great grandma’s pecan pie recipe, or something else entirely.  
### You gain the following characteristics:  
#### Ghostly Wisdom  
>+2 to your Intellect Pool.  
#### Sneaky   
>You’re trained in stealth and intimidation.  
#### Incorporeal   
>You’re trained in Speed defense.  
#### Calling the Dead   
>You’re trained in communicating with other ghosts, wraiths, undead, and so on. You can also serve as a catalyst for communication with the dead, providing an asset to a living character attempting such a task (such as a séance or summoning).  
#### Insubstantial   
>All physical attacks are hindered.  
#### Dead   
>Positive social interaction tasks with living creatures are hindered.  
#### Uniform   
>You’re permanently wearing the clothes you had on when you died. This can hinder social interactions if you’re inappropriately dressed for the setting (wearing a bathrobe and slippers to a formal party, for example).  
### Initial Link to the Starting Adventure   
From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.  
>1. You’re on a journey to make amends with someone you wronged in life.  
>2. You’re looking for the resting place of your physical body so you can be resurrected.  
>3. One of the other PCs is a distant relative, and you need to keep them alive so your bloodline continues.  
>4. You’re studying the secrets of reincarnation and suspect that one of the other PCs has vital information.
