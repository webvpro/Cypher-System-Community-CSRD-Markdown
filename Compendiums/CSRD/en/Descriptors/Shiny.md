## Shiny    
You’re brash and bright, and you exult in situations, people, and objects that seem to  you as if they have a similar sheen. Literally shiny objects qualify, as well as objects that are not rusted or degraded by time’s passage or the effects of the apocalypse. You also tend to fall into the orbit of people who are strong, unbeaten, and possessed of an inner brightness. You believe that they, like you, reflect the light of some greater spiritual purpose in the world. When you believe you are acting in that glow, you are emboldened and may take risks others fear. You don’t seek death, but you’re confident that death in the pursuit of something shiny is the definition of a life well-lived.  
### You gain the following characteristics    
> #### Lithe  
> +2 to your Speed Pool.    
  
> #### Skill  
> You’ve had practice driving a before-times vehicle. Choose a motorcycle, car or truck, or long-haul truck; you’re trained in driving that kind of vehicle.    
  
> #### Skill  
> You know how to get out of the way. You are trained in Speed defense tasks.   
  
> #### Shiny Maneuver  
> You know how to push yourself harder, at the risk of a more dramatic failure. When you attempt a shiny maneuver, you ease a task, attack roll, or defense roll, but in doing so you increase the intrusion range by two for that roll, to a 1–3 on a d20. If you fail and decide to retry the task (requiring that you spend a level of Effort, as normal), it has the same increased intrusion range. Once you attempt a shiny maneuver, you can’t attempt another until you make a recovery roll. Enabler.  
  
> #### Inability  
> You may be lithe and shiny, but you’re not sneaky. Tasks related to sneaking and staying quiet are hindered.  
  
> #### Inability  
> You are irrepressible, but that makes it hard to dissemble. Deception and disguise tasks are hindered.  
  
>### Additional Equipment    
>You have a treasured object that is literally shiny in bright light, such as a polished stainless-steel sphere, a silver coin, a pocket watch from the before-times, or something else small and easily carried.
