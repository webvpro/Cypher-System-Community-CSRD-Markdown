## Bewitched  
You’re not sure that your thoughts are always your own. You often hear a voice or voices, guiding you and attempting to force your hand. Sometimes these voices are helpful and kind. Other times, not so much. Where do they come from, and are you cursed or blessed by them?
### You gain the following characteristics:
#### Enchanted
>+4 to your Intellect Pool.
#### Skill 
>You are trained in all tasks involving listening and hearing.
#### Insight
>The voices have many things to tell you and some of them are beneficial. Once after each ten-hour recovery roll, you can use a player intrusion without spending an XP.
Inability: The voices in your head are sometimes so loud it’s hard to make sense of the real world. You have an inability in navigation, tracking, and identifying plants and animals.
### Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:
From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
1. You listened to one of your voices, which suggested that this would be a good thing to embark upon.
2. One of the other PCs sounds an awful lot like one of your voices, and you’d like to spend time with them to find out if there’s a connection.
3. You have reason to believe that being with the other PCs could help you gain a better understanding of the thoughts and voices you hear.
4. You find that you can hear the voices more clearly when you’re doing something active, and this seemed like a good fit.
