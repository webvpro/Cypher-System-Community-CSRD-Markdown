## Morlock  
You have lived your life deep underground in artificial bunkers, hidden from the world's destruction and the brutal scavengers that live above. As a morlock, you have a keen mind for the technology salvaged from the before-time. In fact, every morlock comes of age by fitting a piece of morlock technology to its body to provide enhancement and extend its life. This means that you are part flesh and part machine. Your skin is as pale as milk, except where it's been replaced with strips of metal and glowing circuits.
### You gain the following characteristics  
> #### Enhanced Intelligence
> +2 to your Intellect Pool.  

> #### Cyborg Body
> +2 to your Might Pool and your Speed Pool.  

> #### Partially Metallic
> +1 to Armor.  

> #### Repair and Maintenance
> As an entity of living flesh and humming machinery, you must first succeed on a difficulty 2 repair task before making a recovery roll. On a failure, the recovery roll is not used; however, the normal rules for retrying apply, and you must use Effort on a new roll if you wish to try again. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to heal additional points to your Pools (each level of Effort healing an additional 2 points to your Pools if you succeed).  

> #### Morlock Prejudice
> While among non-morlocks, all positive interaction tasks are hindered.  

### Initial Link to the Starting Adventure  
From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.  
- The PCs found you in a collapsed subterranean tunnel.  
- The other PCs encountered you exploring underground, and you convinced them to allow you to accompany them.  
- You were exiled from the morlock communities and needed help on the surface.  
- The only way to save the morlock community you hail from is to venture to the surface and find a mechanical part needed to repair a failing ancient system.
