## Hunter    
You once rode with the Wild Hunt: an immortal cavalry who traversed the skies in secret each night, gathering the souls of those who died in battle and carrying them to the beyond. These days, the Wild Hunt has downsized and your nights are your own. You’re mortal again, too, but it’s impossible to forget the terrifying freedom and power you once held. Maybe you’ve let nostalgia make you bitter, or maybe you don’t miss the Hunt at all, instead living in fear of being conscripted once more.  
### You gain the following characteristics:  
#### Agile  
>+2 to your Speed Pool.  
#### Equestrian   
>You’re trained in handling and riding horses.  
#### Sword Hand   
>You’re proficient with two-handed swords and can use them without penalty.  
#### Hearing the Dead   
>You’re skilled in all social interactions with ghosts.  
#### The Call of the Hunt  
>You’re often distracted by sounds that remind you of the Wild Hunt, such as horns and baying hounds. Tasks requiring concentration are hindered.  
#### Lost Years   
>In the years you belonged to the Wild Hunt, you lost touch with advancing technology. Tasks involving computers, pop culture, and recent history are hindered.  
### Initial Link to the Starting Adventure   
From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.  
>1. You ferried the soul of a PC’s relative to the afterlife. When you left the Wild Hunt, you found the PC to tell them of their relative’s brave deeds.  
>2. The living only see the Wild Hunt cross the sky if they’re destined for disaster. A PC saw the Wild Hunt years ago, and you’ve taken it upon yourself to protect them.  
>3. You’re afraid that the leader of the Wild Hunt will summon you, and you need help concealing yourself.  
>4. You’re searching for the horse you remember riding—a massive undead stallion with flaming hooves.
