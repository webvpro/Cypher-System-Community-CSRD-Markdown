## Flutter  
You emerged from the chrysalis with your mind awash in skills instilled while you matured, as well as knowledge handed down from your ancestors. If the stories are true, some of your knowledge comes from even further back, ceded by godlike "humans" who raised flutters into the light of self-knowledge. That was before humans were lost, leaving the world in ruins. Ruins that are now yours to refurbish and rebuild or, as many prefer, to  ignore while you instead go your own way. Humans may have created you, but they're gone, and you can decide what you think you owe them, if anything.
As a flutter, you are kin to the much smaller natural moths that still flit by night. But you have an internal skeleton and lungs, and are far larger. For all that, you also have wings, a proboscis, and much thinner limbs than the average animal still roaming the world.
### You gain the following characteristics  
> #### Quick
> +2 to your Speed Pool.  

> #### Skill
> You are adept at using your body's natural patterns of camouflage. You are trained in hiding.  

> #### Darksight
> You can see in dim light as though it were bright light and can see in darkness as though it were dim light. Enabler.  

> #### Fragile
> When you fail a Might defense roll to avoid damage, you take 1 extra point of damage.  

> #### Inability
> You are confused by bright light. Perception tasks are hindered in bright light.  

> #### Erratic Flyer
> You can select Hover as if it were on your type's list of tier 1 abilities. Your ability to move as described in Hover is due to your wings. In addition to the base ability described for Hover, if you succeed on a difficulty 2 Intellect roll, you can keep your position in the air instead of drifting with the wind or allowing momentum to move you.  

### Initial Link to the Starting Adventure  
From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.  
- Some piece of knowledge gleaned from your time in the chrysalis made you seek out and join the PCs.  
- The ruins are where knowledge of humans exists, and you heard the PCs were headed there.  
- You overheard the PCs talking about a grand adventure, and you wanted to be part of it.  
- You zigged when you should have zagged and ran headlong into the PCs. They patched you up and you stayed with them.
