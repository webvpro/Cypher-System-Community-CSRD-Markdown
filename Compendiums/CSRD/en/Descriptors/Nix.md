## Nix  
You’re a shapeshifting water spirit. You can walk on two legs and breathe air, but when you’re submerged, you gain a tail, fins, and gills. You probably live near flowing water, with no preference for salinity or temperature; you also have a general affinity for nature and a knack for identifying useful plants. Your playful and upbeat disposition doesn’t mean you’re passive or helpless. Though you may prefer to talk your way out of tough situations, you’re quick to react to threats especially in water, where you maneuver with deadly accuracy.
### You gain the following characteristics:
#### Transformation 
>When submerged in water, you transform into a fish/human hybrid with gills, fins, sharp teeth, and a tail. This transformation is automatic. Enabler.
#### Unchillable 
>+2 Armor against damage caused by cold or ice.
#### Sharp Teeth 
>You are skilled in making an unarmed bite attack, which is a medium weapon in your aquatic form and a light weapon in your humanoid form. Enabler.
#### Quick Swimming
