## Vacuum Cycle    
    
>Two-wheeled vehicle, supporting a reinforced, lightly enclosed and pressurized frame with a seat for one rider (and sometimes a passenger), providing the rider Armor 1 (though if damage is taken, it's likely a breach has occurred). Auto-stabilization eases all tasks related to riding. Suitable for paved and broken surfaces on airless moons or in polluted or poisonous atmospheres; moves a long distance each round on paved and broken surfaces or an average of 80 km/h (50 mph) during long-distance travel.
