## Lantern    
    
>An improved version of a lamp, with a wick that draws oil and glass or metal panes to protect it from wind. A lantern creates normal light in an immediate area and dim light out to the short area beyond that. It burns for three to four hours on 1 pint (.5 L) of oil. If dropped, it is less likely to spill than a lamp.    
> **Options :** Fantasy, Utility Gear    
> **Value :** Moderate, 5 Gp
