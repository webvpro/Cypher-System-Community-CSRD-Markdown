## Land Ark  
  
>Treaded, all-terrain wheels support a completely enclosed interior habitat with five to ten interior chambers arranged either to house one or more families, support scientific research, exploration, spying, or configured for some other purpose to support a team of individuals. Moves an immediate distance each round in utterly wild terrain, a short distance each round in broken terrain or an average of 64 km/h (40 mph) during long-distance travel (double movement on paved surfaces, though a land ark rarely finds roads).
