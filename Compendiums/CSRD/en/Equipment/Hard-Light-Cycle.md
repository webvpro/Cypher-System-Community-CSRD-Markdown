## Hard-Light Cycle    
    
>Two-wheeled vehicle of hard light capable of adapting to most terrains, supporting a sleek reinforced, armored frame with a seat for one rider (and sometimes a passenger) partly open the environment, providing the rider Armor 1. Suitable for crossing above any surface via self-deploying light bridge, a 1 cm (3 inch) thick by 3 m (10 feet) wide, constantly extending forcefield surface that persists for about ten minutes. The bridge can reach to almost any height, though maximum gradient shouldn't exceed 30%. Auto-stabilization eases all tasks related to riding by two steps. Moves a long distance each round on self-deploying bridge or an average of 190 km/h (120 mph) during long-distance travel.
