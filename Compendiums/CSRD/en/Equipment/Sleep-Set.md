## Sleep Set  
  
>A thin metallic (but comfortable, padded) headset that rests on the temples and induces a deep (dreamless) sleep state for a specified period, usually no more than three to six hours. Fail-safes can be set to bring a user out of sleep if loud noises, movement, someone addresses the sleeper, or other triggers occur. Users find themselves extremely well rested after each use.
