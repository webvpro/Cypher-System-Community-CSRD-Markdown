## Hibernation Pod    
    
>A pod large enough to contain a human, with internal mechanisms and power able to safely put a person into a deep state of arrested metabolism for about a hundred years, unless the program ends sooner or the pod is opened from the exterior. Each hundred years thereafter, the hibernating human must succeed on a Might defense task. The difficulty begins at 1, but increases by +1 every few hundred years that pass.
