## Motorcycle, Omni-Terrain  
  
>Two-wheeled vehicle with telescoping spokes capable of adapting to nearly any terrain (except water or other liquids), supporting a basic frame with a seat for one rider (and sometimes a passenger) open to the environment, ideal for utterly wild terrain and off-road travel; able to "climb" natural steep and near-vertical surfaces. Auto-stabilization eases all tasks related to riding. Moves a long distance each round in any terrain or an average of 112 km/h (70 mph) during long-distance travel.
