>Cloth armor that is deliberately designed with multiple layers to be thick and protective. This is sometimes called "quilted armor" because it is a layer of padding sewn between two layers of cloth. Padded armor provides 1 Armor against piercing or slashing attacks like arrows and swords, but not bashing attacks like clubs or hammers. Padded armor doesn't have a Speed Effort cost. It can't be worn with other kinds of armor.
