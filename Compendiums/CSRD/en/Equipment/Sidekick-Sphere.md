## Sidekick Sphere  
  
>Circuit-inscribed, and jauntily decorated, smart-material sphere about 1 m (3 feet) in diameter that rolls or jumps to stay within an immediate distance of owner. Capable of playing music, pulsing with light, engaging in witty conversation, and in keeping confidence. Treat the sidekick sphere as a level 2 follower (and limited sim AI).
