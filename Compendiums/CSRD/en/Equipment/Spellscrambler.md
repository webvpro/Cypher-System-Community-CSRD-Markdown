## Spellscrambler  
>Essentially a sonic grenade, this device produces a variety of strange electromagnetic signals some audible and very loud, some not on a number of frequencies. The mental processes needed to cast a spell are impossible to achieve for one round within a short distance of the device. Like any grenade, it can be used only once.
