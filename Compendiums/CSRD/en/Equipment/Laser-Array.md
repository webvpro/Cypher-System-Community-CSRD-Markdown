## Laser Array  
  
>even highly focused lasers spread out to several miles after only traveling a few light-seconds, diminishing their usefulness. Also doubles as a spacecraft weapon system (but all attack tasks using it are hindered).  
> **Options :** Advanced, Communication, Science Fiction  
> **Level :** 5  
> **Value :** Exorbitant a Bulky Piece of Equipment that Takes a Few Days, Set up and Calibrate. Useful for Ship-to-Ship Communication for "Tight" Beaming Information
