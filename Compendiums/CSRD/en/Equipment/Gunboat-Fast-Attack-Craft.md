## Gunboat, Fast Attack Craft    
    
>A fast attack craft (FAC) is relatively small and agile (compared to more massive warships), armed with anti-ship missiles, guns, and/or torpedoes. Features both open decks and a couple of completely enclosed interior chambers. A gunboat is cramped, has little room for food or water, and is not as seaworthy as it could be (all tasks related to operating the craft, except vehicular combat, are hindered). Moves a long distance each round or up to 96 km/h (60 mph) on calm water (half movement rates in choppy water). Requires a trained crew and central coordination to operate.
