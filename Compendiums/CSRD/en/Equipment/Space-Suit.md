## Space Suit    
    
>Protects a wearer from vacuum and allows basic normal activities in space. Requires about four rounds to put on and seal (going quicker risks a bad seal). Provides about ten hours of atmo in a vacuum without refurbishment. Extremely limited maneuvering thrusters provide a couple of opportunities to correct a poorly aimed jump through zero G. Shipboots are usually built in.
