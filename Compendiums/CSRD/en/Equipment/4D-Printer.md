## 4D Printer  
  
>Prints a variety of basic objects, including protein bars, parts, wires, tools, and even small powered devices and equipment of up to level 4 and that are expensive or less. Requires special feedstock, which is an expensive cost to replace after every dozen or so uses, though items printed by the 4D printer can be recycled, extending the feedstock supply accordingly. Many long-haul spacecraft seek to obtain a 4D printer because having one significantly reduces the amount of material that must otherwise be carried.
