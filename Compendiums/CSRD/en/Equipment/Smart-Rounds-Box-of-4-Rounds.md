## Smart Rounds (Box of 4 Rounds)  
  
>A smart round can be used to make one normal attack plus up to 3 additional ricochet attacks on targets within short range of the attacker and each other as one action. Each ricochet attack successively increases the GM intrusion range by 2. If a GM intrusion is triggered, the ricochet attack hits something other than what the attacker intended, such as an important system or ally.  
> **Options :** Advanced, Armament, Fantastic, Science Fiction
