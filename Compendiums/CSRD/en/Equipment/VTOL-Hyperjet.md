## VTOL Hyperjet  
  
>Swept-back enclosed airframe with seats for a pilot and up to eight passengers. Built-in weapons include long-range Gatling-style cannons (treat as superior weapons). VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) allows the hyperjet incredible maneuverability. Auto-stabilization eases all tasks related to piloting (other than vehicular combat). Flies a very long distance each round using jets or an average of over 2,410 km/h (1,500 mph) during extended trips.
