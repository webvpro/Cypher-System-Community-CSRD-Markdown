## Orb, Personal    
    
>Deployed from a fist-sized sphere as an action, the personal orb takes shape around a single traveler, forming an environment force field that shields wind and air turbulence, keeping the atmosphere at a comfortable temperature, and providing Armor 1. Once deployed, the orb pilots itself as directly as possible, flying to a destination at very long distance per round or up to 480 km/h (300 mph) during an extended trip, with a maximum duration of up to thirty-six hours. Personal orbs are usually single-use transports.
