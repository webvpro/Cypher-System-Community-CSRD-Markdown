## Gun Armor  
  
>As battle armor, but armor includes a deployable integrated long-range plasma weapon that inflicts 6 points of damage. It's able to fire autonomously, allowing the wearer to take some other action (though if set to do so, automatic GM intrusions occur on 1-3 on a d20, and if triggered, result in friendly fire).
