## Colossal Battle Mech    
    
>A 78 m (255 feet) tall powered anthropomorphic exoskeleton frame. Creates a sealed enclosure (qualifying it for vehicular combat) with life support for an operator and a crew of up to six people. Armed with a massive "melee" plasma sword and "mech-punch" (melee attacks that can be made at long range), plus very long-range missiles, grenades, and energy weapons, operable by the pilot and crew at up to five different independent weapon stations simultaneously; treat as having superior weapons. Can run and fly up to a very long distance each round, and can even ascend into low orbit for brief periods.
