## Space Suit, Deluxe    
    
>As space suit, but deluxe and durable. A deluxe suit features built-in recyclers granting air, water, and nutrition for about a week of continuous use. Microthrusters allow for continuous zero-G maneuvering over a period of ten minutes, or even more if air reserves are tapped (which depletes them). If the suit is breached because of external damage, self-sealing tech limits repercussions described in Taking Damage in a Space Suit to just a round or two, assuming the breach is not catastrophically large.
