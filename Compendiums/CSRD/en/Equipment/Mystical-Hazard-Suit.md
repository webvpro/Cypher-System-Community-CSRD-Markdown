## Magic Detector    
>This full-body protective suit is cumbersome and clumsy, not unlike a hazmat suit. However, all of the wearerâ€™s tasks to resist magical effects are eased. If the wearer takes even 1 point of physical damage, the suit rips and no longer functions until it is repaired and resealed.   
    
> **Options :** Magical Technology
