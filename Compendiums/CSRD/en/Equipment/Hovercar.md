## Hovercar    
    
>Hover frame with a seat for driver and up to four other passengers, often open to the environment (luxury versions have retractable hardtops). Inboard (or external) rotors force air down, allowing the vehicle to hover up to 1 m (3 feet) over any terrain (including water and other liquids). Ideal for utterly wild terrain and over-water excursions. Moves a long distance each round in any terrain or an average of 160 km/h (100 mph) during longdistance travel.
