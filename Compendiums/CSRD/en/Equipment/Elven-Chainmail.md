## Elven Chainmail    
    
>A high-quality suit of chainmail crafted by a skilled elf, providing good protection and excellent mobility. Elven chainmail is Medium armor (2 Armor) but is no more encumbering than a typical outfit of normal clothing (it has no Speed Effort cost). Not all elf-crafted chainmail counts as this type of armor (only exceptionally skilled elven smiths know how to make it).    
> **Options :** Fantasy, Utility Gear    
> **Value :** Very Expensive, 8,000 Gp    
>>[!note] Features
