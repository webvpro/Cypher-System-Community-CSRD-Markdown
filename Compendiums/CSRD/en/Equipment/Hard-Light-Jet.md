## Hard-Light Jet    
    
>Composed of hard light and pseudo-matter, this futuristic airframe has seats for a pilot and up to two passengers. Built-in weapons include very long-range energy cannons. Auto-stabilization eases all tasks related to piloting by two steps (except for vehicular combat). Flies a very long distance each round using jets or an average of over 8,000 km/h (5,000 mph) during extended trips, and can even make low-orbit rendezvous.
