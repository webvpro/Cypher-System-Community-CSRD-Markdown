## Hover Speedster  
  
>A sweptback frame with a seat for one rider (and often a passenger) open to the environment, with anti-gravity repulsors allowing it to hover up to 2 m (6 feet) over any terrain (including water and other liquids), ideal for utterly wild terrain and over-water excursions. Auto-stabilization eases all tasks related to riding by two steps. Moves a very long distance each round in any terrain or an average of 240 km/h (150 mph) during long-distance travel.
