## Serum, Acceleration    
    
>As remedial serum, but allows user to ignore the many deleterious physiological effects of acceleration and high-G maneuvers (of up to 15 Gs) for one hour (or of up to 20 Gs for a few minutes). Users are likely unable to move under high G, but won't pass out, have a stroke, cardiac arrest, etc.--at least, not immediately. Prolonged use may still lead to all these outcomes.
