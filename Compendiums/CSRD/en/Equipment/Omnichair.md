## Omnichair    
    
>Provides user full mobility via combination of micro thrusters, retractable wheels, and maglev levitation in all environments (from microgravity to full gravity), often contains a variety of tools and enhancements that grant the user assets to common tasks (possibly including a built-in weapon system). If customized to do so for an additional very expensive cost, can extend a fairing, enabling the omnichair to act as a sort of space suit/miniature spacecraft at need.
