## Car, Sports    
    
>Four-wheeled vehicle, supporting a "rolling work of art" frame focusing on flamboyance and swagger, sometimes at the expense of practicality and efficiency. Seats for a driver and usually only a single passenger; operable/easily breakable glass windows (and or retractable hardtop) provide openness to environment. Auto-stabilization eases all tasks related to driving. Moves a long distance each round on paved surfaces or an average of 144 km/h (90 mph) during extended trips.
