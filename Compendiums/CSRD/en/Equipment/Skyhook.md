## Skyhook    
    
>Heavy rotating space station orbiting a moon or planet that extends two massive tethers opposite each other, so that one tether periodically dips deep into the atmosphere close to the surface. At this point, payloads are hooked to the end of the cable as the tether passes, and are then flung into orbit by the station's massive rotation. The skyhook can decelerate and safely de-orbit other payloads in the same way.
