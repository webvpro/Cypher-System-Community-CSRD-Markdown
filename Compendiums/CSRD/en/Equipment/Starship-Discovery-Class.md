## Starship, Discovery Class  
  
>A large research starship with quarters for crew and staff of up to 150 or more people. Has either centrifugal artificial gravity (or in a fantastic tech-rated setting, gravitic compensators providing shipboard gravity control). Primarily designed as a research and discovery vehicle, such starships also have three weapon systems, usually a couple of blaster cannons and a torpedo battery. Highly configurable, a discovery class ship could be converted for war with sufficient resources, granting it superior weapons.
