## Mech, Interceptor    
    
>As infantry mech, but upgrades include complete and sealed enclosure with life support (qualifying it for vehicular combat). Attacks in the interceptor mech also include a battery of very long-range missiles. An additional flight mode allows the interceptor to fly a very long distance for up to ten minutes before recharge is required. Some mechs have superior weapons, defense, or speed, but that doubles the cost.    
> **Options :** Advanced, Mechs and Tanks, Science Fiction    
> **Level :** 4    
> **Value :** Exorbitant
