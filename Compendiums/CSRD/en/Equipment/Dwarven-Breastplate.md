## Dwarven Breastplate    
    
>A high-quality breastplate crafted by a skilled dwarf, providing good protection and great mobility. Dwarven breastplate is Medium armor (2 Armor) but encumbers the wearer as if it were light armor (it has a Speed Effort cost of 1). Not all dwarf-crafted breastplates count as this type of armor (only exceptionally skilled dwarven smiths know how to make it).
