To activate the bridle, the user must succeed on an Intellect interaction with a beast whose level does not exceed the artifact level. The bridle bonds to the creature, which immediately becomes calm. The creature awaits the user's commands and carries out orders to the best of its ability. The creature remains calmed for a number of hours equal to the artifact's level minus the creature's level. (If the result is 0 or less, the creature is enslaved for only one minute.)
