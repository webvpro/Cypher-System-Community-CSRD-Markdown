## Poor Magicianâ€™s Lunchbox

>1d6 
#### Form
>Small metal lunchbox with an illustration of a person enjoying a picnic lunch 
#### Effect
> The lunchbox creates a set of sturdy compostable utensils and a compostable bowl filled to the brim with a bland-tasting porridge that provides enough nutrition for one person for one day (enough for two people if the artifact is level 5 or higher). The porridge is non-allergenic, gluten free, dairy free, meat free, and cruelty free.
