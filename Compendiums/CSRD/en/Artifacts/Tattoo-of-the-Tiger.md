## Tattoo of the Tiger  
  
>1d6 + 2  
#### Form  
>Tattoo of a nonmagical creature, such as a tiger, spider, domesticated dog, raven, or horse  
#### Effect  
>Allows the user to shapeshift into the form of the creature depicted in the tattoo. The creature is nearly impossible to tell from other creatures of its ilk, meaning it’s the same size, moves the same way, vocalizes the same way, has the same coloration, and so on. Once shapeshifted, the user can only do things that the creature could do in its normal state, such as run, roar, fly, swim, and so on. They cannot do things as a human would, but they could talk as a raven might talk, use a device as a primate might, and so on. The shapeshifted user otherwise retains their base stats. The form lasts for ten minutes per artifact level.  
  
#### Depletion   
>1 in 1d20   
>Because tattoo artifacts are magical, they can be transferred from one person’s skin to another’s. For example, if a character kills someone with a still-usable tattoo, they can press their skin to the tattoo and it will appear on their body.
