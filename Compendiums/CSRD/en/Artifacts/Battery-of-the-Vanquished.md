## Battery of the Vanquished  
#### Level   
>1d6 + 4  
#### Form  
> Small metal pipe that’s been etched with elaborate symbols    
#### Effect  
> Allows the user to “borrow” people’s minds the same way that one might borrow a library book. The person must be agreeable to sharing their knowledge and must be within short range of the user when the exchange happens. For the next 24 hours, the user has access to the person’s brain from anywhere, allowing them to become trained in two noncombat skills or specialized in one noncombat skill. The skill they choose must make sense for the person whose brain they’re “borrowing” (for example, a professor of English lit would likely be skilled in speed-reading and storytelling, but maybe not in woodworking or cooking). They can only borrow one person’s mind each day.   
#### Depletion   
>1 in 1d6
