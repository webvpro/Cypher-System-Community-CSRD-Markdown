When the user looks into the mirror and interacts with it, it grants their request, as it is able. Most mirror mirrors have a personality all their own. Some sing their answers, some show images, and still others sigh with boredom at being asked the same thing over and over. Mirrors never lie. Except when they do. Roll a d6 to determine the mirror's ability:  

|  Roll &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |   |  
| ------------- | :----------- |  
| 1 | Answers a question about the present (such as "Who is the fairest of them all?") with a simple one- or two-word answer. |  
| 2 | Allows the viewer to check in on someone they know (and who knows them) from anywhere. The image lasts just a moment, and those being viewed are not aware that it has happened. |  
| 3 | If the viewer stands before the mirror and shouts their own name three times, they are granted a glimpse of their future. This glimpse lasts just a moment, and is not guaranteed to come true. |  
| 4 | If the viewer stands before the mirror at midnight while holding a light source, they are able to contact the ghost or spirit of a person or creature they know the name of. Whether or not the being agrees to talk with them is another matter. |  
| 5 | Distorts the appearance of everything it reflects, particularly by magnifying the horrible and ugly aspects of things and people while ignoring their good and beautiful aspects. Looking into the mirror inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage. Angling the mirror to reflect an object inflicts 2 points of damage to it. |  
| 6 | Coats the user's skin with its reflective surface, offering protection. The first time the user would take damage, the mirror shatters instead, reflecting the damage back to the user's attacker. |
