## Ghostly Armor  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+3  
> **Form:** Full Suit of Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor  
> **Depletion:** 1 in 1D10 (for the Ghostly Defense Ability, but After Depletion, the Suit Still Functions as Normal Armor and Provides Its Full Armor Value)  
> **Kind:** Fantasy
  
This armor is carefully crafted and reinforced with magic to be stronger and more protective than typical armor. It is armor according to its type (light, medium, or heavy), but it grants an additional +1 Armor beyond what it would normally provide. For example, chainmail is medium armor (2 Armor), so ghostly chainmail provides 3 Armor. When activated, the armor randomly makes the wearer ghostly and immaterial for ten minutes (or for one hour if the artifact is level 9 or higher), which hinders attacks on the wearer by two steps without hindering any of the character's abilities. Special multidimensional weapons or attacks (such as abilities meant to harm ghosts) ignore this defense.
