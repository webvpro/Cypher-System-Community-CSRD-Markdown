## Storm Shack  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+3  
> **Form:** Miniature Model of a Simple Wooden Shack  
> **Depletion:** 1 in 1D100  
> **Kind:** Fantasy
  
Activating the artifact transforms it over the next few rounds into a simple wooden shack that is 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m) with a thin door. Everything inside the area of the full-size shack is protected from most forms of inclement weather for one hour (or ten hours for artifact level 6 and higher). Leaving or entering the shack before the duration is up makes it harmlessly collapse upon itself unless the character succeeds on a Speed roll against the artifact's level. If collapsed early or the duration runs out, the shack collapses into sticks, dust, and the miniature model, which can be taken and reused.
