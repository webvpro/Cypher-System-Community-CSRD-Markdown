## Ring of Reflected Bullets

#### Form
>Red gold ring engraved with a chaotic bullet pattern 
#### Effect
> When targeted with a ranged attack from a firearm that fires bullets, the wearer can attempt a hindered Speed defense roll. If the roll succeeds, the bullet rebounds before hitting the wearer and immediately returns to the sender, effectively granting the wearer a free attack against the shooter fired from the shooterâ€™s weapon. The wearer is practiced with this attack.
