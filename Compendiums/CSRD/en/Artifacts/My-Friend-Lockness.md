#### Form  
>Silver lapel pin in the shape of the Loch Ness monster   
#### Effect  
> When activated, the back of the pin opens up to reveal a number of helpful miniature tools, including a lockpick, tweezers, screwdriver, and so on. Using the pin provides an asset in both magical and mundane tasks such as lockpicking and crafting. In addition, it allows the user to perceive items, creatures, spells, and doors that would normally be hidden by easing their perception tasks by two steps (three steps if the cypher is level 7 or higher).
