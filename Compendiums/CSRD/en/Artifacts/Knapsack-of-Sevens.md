Tapping the knapsack seven times causes seven swans to fly out. For as long as the user does not speak or make any sounds, the swans fly around the user, providing them with +1 Armor against mental and physical attacks for the next ten minutes. As soon as the user utters a sound, the swans return to the knapsack.
