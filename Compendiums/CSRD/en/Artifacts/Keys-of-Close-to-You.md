## Keys of Close to You   
>1d6 +4  
#### Form  
>Two small gold keys, each with a simple bow   
#### Effect  
> When activated by two people standing together, the bows of the keys magically adjust to create an abstract representation of the two usersâ€™ relationship. At any time, one of the users can teleport themselves to the other person instantly, from up to 50 miles (80 km) away. For this to work, both people must have their key on their person, and there must be no magical barriers in place that are higher level than the artifact.   
#### Depletion   
>1 in 1d20 (check each teleportation)
