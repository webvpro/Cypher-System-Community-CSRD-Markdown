This device emits an invisible beam of neural-magnetic energy as a short-range attack that instantly reverses how a level 1 target sees the user (turning an enemy into a friend, and vice versa) for up to one day. The user can adjust the settings to increase the ray's effectiveness by making one additional depletion roll per increase in the maximum level of the target. Thus, to alter the attitude of level 5 target (4 levels above the normal limit), the user must make five depletion rolls. If used against a PC, an affected PC can attempt an Intellect task to end the effect once every minute for the first few minutes, then once every hour.
