This weapon contains an onboard AI that assists the user, granting an asset to any attacks made with the weapon. The weapon fires a stream of nanomachine rounds at a target within long range, inflicting damage equal to the artifact's level. In addition, if the target fails an Intellect defense roll, they are affected as if with a minor AI instance hazard, coming under the control of the AI housed in the nanorifle rather than a random artificial intelligence. The AI usually works with the user to exert control over the target. Control lasts for about a minute.
