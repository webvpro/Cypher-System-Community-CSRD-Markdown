## Cloud Thief
>1d6
#### Form
> Ring that alters to perfectly fit the wearer (in size and appearance) 

#### Effect
> Allows the user to copy a cypher app from any device the user chooses within long range. The ring chooses randomly from the available apps on that device, and the user doesnâ€™t know what the app is until they receive it. They can activate the cypher app directly from the ring or download it into a device of their choice. The ring can only hold one app at a time, and that app does count against the userâ€™s cypher limit. 
#### Depletion 
>1 in 1d20
