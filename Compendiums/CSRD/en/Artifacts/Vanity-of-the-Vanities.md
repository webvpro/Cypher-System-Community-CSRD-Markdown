## Vanity of the Vanities  
  
>1d6  
#### Form  
>Umbrella that folds down to the size of a credit card    
#### Effect  
> The user activates the artifact by pressing the button and staring into the mirror for one minute. As long as they do some type of personal grooming (such as showering, getting dressed, or applying makeup) within short range of the vanity, no time passes for them, allowing them to spend as much time as they need to get ready.   
  
#### Depletion   
>1 in 1d00 (check each hour of extra time granted to the user); after depletion, its magic stops working but it continues to function as a normal mirror
