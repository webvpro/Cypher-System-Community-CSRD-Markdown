## Dragon Pen  
>1d6 +2  
#### Form  
> Quill made from a green feather   
  
#### Effect  
> The user can dip the pen in ink and draw an object or creature, which becomes real for one minute. The object or creatureâ€™s level is half the artifactâ€™s level, +1 level if the user is trained in drawing, or +2 levels if the user is specialized in drawing. Once released from the page or surface it was drawn upon, the object or creature swells until it reaches the appropriate size, but it grows no bigger than an immediate distance in width, depth, and height. If a creature is made, it does the bidding of the user.   
>  
>Someone familiar with magic made from drawings or illustrations, such as someone who has the Inks Spells on Skin focus, can use the pen as part of casting their spells, easing the task of casting the spell.  
#### Depletion   
>1 in 1d10
