## Ecosensitive Fridge Magnets  
>1d6   
#### Form  
> Set of refrigerator magnets (two of each letter and two of each number 0 through 9) made out of bone or wood   
  
#### Effect  
> Ghosts, haunts, wraiths, poltergeists, and other spectral creatures can move these objects as easily as a human can, using them to spell out messages visible to anyone in the area. Usually, the magnets are also enchanted so these creatures can’t remove them from the surface they’re attached to (preventing the creatures from stealing, hiding, or throwing them).   
  
  
#### Depletion   
>1 in 1d20 (check each day of use); depletion means one of the magnets is lost forever but the remainder continue to function
