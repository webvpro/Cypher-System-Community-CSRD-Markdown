## Busy Box
#### Level 
>1d6
#### Form
> Small wooden box with a remote opener 
#### Effect
> Opening the box reveals a dazzling array of enticing things to do, see, hear, and experience. These enticements are magically geared to those experiencing them. Everyone who fails an Intellect defense roll within short range of the box is so distracted that theyâ€™re hindered on all actions for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level. (NPCs whose level is less than the artifact level are automatically affected.) The remote will open and close the box from up to long range away. 
#### Depletion 
>1 in 1d20
