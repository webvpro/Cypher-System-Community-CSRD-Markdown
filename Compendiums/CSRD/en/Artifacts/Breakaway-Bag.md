## Breakaway Bag
#### Level 
>1d6 + 4
#### Form
> : Backpack, purse, or duffel covered in patches 
#### Effect
> This bag can hold a number of magic items (including cyphers and artifacts) equal to the artifact level. Every item the user places inside the bag instantly turns into a patch on the bag’s surface. Only the user can recognize these patches as the objects they once were, and only the user can turn them back into their original items (doing so takes an action). The bag can also be used as a regular bag to hold mundane items, which does not affect how many magic items it can hold. Cyphers in the bag do not count against the user’s cypher limit. 
#### Depletion 
>1 in 1d20 (roll each time a magic item is added)
