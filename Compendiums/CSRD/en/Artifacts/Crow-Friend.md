## Crow Friend   
>1d6 +4  
#### Form  
> Pocket-sized figurine of a crow, its feathers worn from being lovingly petted over time   
  
#### Effect  
> For as long as the user carries the figurine on their person and does not actively harm, scare, or otherwise offend any living corvids, a flock of crows may show up randomly once per day to assist them. The crows arrive on their own time and act as crows do, attempting to help the user in the way that they deem most useful, such as dropping stones on a foeâ€™s head, warning them of incoming dangers, bringing them a snack, and so on.   
#### Depletion   
>1 in 1d00 (roll each time the crows arrive)
