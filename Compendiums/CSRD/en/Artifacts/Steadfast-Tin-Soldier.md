Gives a user who is missing a limb the ability to transform the tin soldier into a prosthetic limb with the appearance of their choosing. The limb permanently increases the user's maximum Speed Pool or Might Pool (user's choice) by 5 points (or 7 points if the artifact is level 6 or higher). It is rumored that there are a number of artifacts that create prosthetic body parts or restore missing limbs, including Paper Ballerina, Handless Maiden, and Bianca's Snake.
