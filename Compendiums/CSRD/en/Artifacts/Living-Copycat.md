## Living Copycat   
>1d6  
#### Form  
>Collection of metal magnets in a small tin   
#### Effect  
> If the user spends about an hour shaping the metal magnets into a copy of a living entity theyâ€™ve seen or have an image of, such as a human, cat, or dragon, the living metal takes the shape of that entity (albeit at about a tenth of its size). The copycat does and says everything that the living entity is doing, at the moment that theyâ€™re doing it. The copycat lasts for ten minutes per artifact level, after which it returns to a collection of magnets.   
#### Depletion
