## Angelic Ward  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+2  
> **Form:** Tiny Figurine of a Winged Angel  
> **Depletion:** 1 in 1D10  
> **Kind:** Fantasy
  
Once activated, the figurine's spirit emerges and becomes semisolid as a glowing, human-sized winged angel. It follows within 3 feet (1 m) of the figurine owner. Anything within long range that attacks the owner is attacked by the angelic ward, which sends out a bolt of flesh-rotting energy, doing damage equal to the artifact's level. Once activated, it functions for a day.
