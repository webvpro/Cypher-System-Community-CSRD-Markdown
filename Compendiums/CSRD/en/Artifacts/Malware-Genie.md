#### Form  
>Thumb drive with the image of a lamp engraved on it   
#### Effect  
> Inserting the thumb drive into a device produces the avatar of a genie who grants the user a single wish. The GM assigns a level to the wish, so the larger and more difficult the wish, the more difficult it is to have the wish granted. Generally, a wish such as gaining an asset or inexpensive item is level 1, and a wish for an expensive item or for a foe to vanish is level 7. The genie cannot grant a wish above its level. The genie can grant only one wish per day.
