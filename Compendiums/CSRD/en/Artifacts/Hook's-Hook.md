When placed on an amputated limb, the hook grafts on permanently. It works as a simple hook and as a light weapon. When activated, Hook's hook affects the minds of all thinking foes within long range. Those affected are instilled with terror, making them drop whatever they're holding and flee for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level. There are rumored to be any number of Hook's hooks, all of which are made from different materials and serve different purposes, such as the scissors hook, oar hook, magnet hook, teacup hook, grappling-hook hook, and fishing rod hook. Enterprising characters might seek out multiple hooks, along with a way to exchange them easily.
