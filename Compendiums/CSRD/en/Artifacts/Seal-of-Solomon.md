The wearer can attempt to command a demon, a devil, a Horseman of the Apocalypse, an angel, or a similar entity by making a successful Intellect attack roll against a target within short range. An affected target must do as requested for up to one minute (if the creature is level 5 or lower) or for one round (if the creature is level 6 or higher). The ring also grants the wearer the ability to understand and communicate with animals.
