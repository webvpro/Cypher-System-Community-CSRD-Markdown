Attacks with this spear are eased. If used against a supernatural creature such as a demon, a Horseman of the Apocalypse, or an angel, it ignores Armor, and it inflicts 4 additional points of damage (10 points total). If an attack with the spear kills a target normally able to return to existence (such as a Horseman), the target is truly destroyed instead. Spear of Destiny GM GM intrusion: The wielder's heart is not pure enough to permit the use of the spear, and it burns the character for 7 points of ambient damage each round they use it.
