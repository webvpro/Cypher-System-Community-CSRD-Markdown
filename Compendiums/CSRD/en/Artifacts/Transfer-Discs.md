The user can step between deployed transfer discs, teleporting any distance. If a series of discs is deployed in a network, the user receives a mental map of the discs upon stepping on any one of them, and they can navigate by stepping on each intervening disc between their current location and their desired location. To deploy a disc as their action, the user places it on a mostly level, secure surface and must succeed on a difficulty 3 Intellect-based roll.
