## Metabolic Prod    
>[!info] Stats    
> **Level:** 1d6+1    
> **Form:** 1 M (4 Foot) Metallic Rod of Unknown Material    
> **Depletion:** 1 in 1D20    
> **Kind:** Science Fiction  
    
When touched to a living target (possibly as an attack), the rod injects a potent cocktail of engineered biomolecules, paralyzing the target for up to one minute. The rod wielder may also choose one of the following additional effects, if set before attacking. Aggression: The target's aggressive tendencies are increased for one hour, during which time the target attacks almost anything it encounters. Calm: The target's aggressive tendencies are tamped down for one hour, during which time the target responds to attacks but never initiates them. Hibernation: The target falls into hibernation, a coma-like sleep in which their metabolism slows to a crawl. They can go months with no additional food or water and with a fraction of the air they'd normally need. Loud sounds, damage, persistent prodding, and the like wakes someone in hibernation.
