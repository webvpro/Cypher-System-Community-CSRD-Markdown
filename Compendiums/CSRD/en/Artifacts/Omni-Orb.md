## Omni Orb    
>[!info] Stats    
> **Level:** 1d6+4    
> **Form:** Glowing, Orb-Shaped Technological Device    
> **Depletion:** 1 in 1D6 (Instead of Depleting, a Roll of 1 Means the User Experiences a Gm Intrusion Related to the Effect They Created)    
> **Kind:** Superhero  
    
The user holding the orb imagines what they want to happen (similar to using a magical wish), and it happens, within limits. The level of the effect granted is no greater than the level of the orb, as determined by the GM, who can modify the effect accordingly. (The larger the desired effect, the more likely the GM will limit it.) Activating the omni orb automatically moves the character using it one step down the damage track. A benchmark for setting an omni orb's limits is to compare it to a cypher of the orb's level-if there is a cypher that can do what the PC wants, and that cypher is equal to or less than the orb's level, it works. For example, if a team of superheroes tries to use a level 5 orb to teleport to their base 100 miles away, the GM can look at the list of cyphers and see that a teleporter (traveler) cypher can transport one character up to 100 miles per cypher level, so transporting a group of PCs 100 miles is probably within the orb's power.
