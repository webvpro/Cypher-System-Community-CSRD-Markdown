The arrow explodes when it strikes something, inflicting its level in damage to all within immediate range. Roll d100 to determine the type of damage. One advantage of an exploding arrow over a detonation cypher is that the arrow doesn't count toward your cypher limit. An exploding arrow can instead be a crossbow bolt, sling stone, or other thrown weapon or projectile.
