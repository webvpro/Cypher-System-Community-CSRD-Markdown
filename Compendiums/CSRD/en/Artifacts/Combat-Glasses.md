## Combat Glasses
>1d6
#### Form
> Pair of stylish sunglasses 

#### Effect
> The glasses analyze a foe and display information about the best places to strike them as well as how best to avoid their incoming attacks. If the user spends an action to allow the glasses to analyze a chosen foe, they gain an asset in both melee attacks and Speed defense rolls against the foe. They must take a separate action to analyze each foe, and the glasses can only assist against one foe at a time. 
#### Depletion 
>1 in 1d6 (check after each foe)
