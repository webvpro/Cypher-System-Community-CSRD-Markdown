## Time is a Circle  
  
>1d6 +4  
#### Form  
>Watch with no face and no hands   
#### Effect  
>The user can tell the watch what time it is, and it will be that time for them and only them. The watch face shows them a video of what they were experiencing in the past or will experience in the future (depending on what time they chose). The user cannot change anything about the experience, but they can replay and slow down the video. The video lasts for a number of minutes equal to the artifact level and disappears after. Note that while the video of the past is always accurate, the video of the future shows one of many possible futures and may not come true.
