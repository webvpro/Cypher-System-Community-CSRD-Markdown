This weapon functions as a normal knife of its kind. When the wielder gets a special major effect when attacking, they can choose to lop off one of the target's limbs. The GM determines the effect of a lost limb; however, many magical beings can withstand lost limbs with far more aplomb than a mortal creature will display in a similar situation.
