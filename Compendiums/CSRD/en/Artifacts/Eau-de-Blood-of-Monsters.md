## Eau de Blood of Monsters
>1d6 +4
#### Form
> Red crystal bottle filled with amber perfume 

#### Effect
> This perfume is specially created to be used by a single person. To activate it for the first time, the user must put a single drop of their blood into the bottle, incorporating their own scent into that of the perfume. The result smells amazing to them but is not noticeable to anyone else. 
> 
> After that, whenever the user applies the perfume, it provides +2 Armor (+3 if the artifact is level 9 or higher). Each application lasts for ten minutes per artifact level, and itâ€™s an action to reapply the perfume.
> 
> Anyone else who attempts to wear the perfume quickly realizes it smells awful on their skin, and they take 1 point of damage. 

#### Depletion 
>1 in 1d20
