## History’s Fickle Hands  
>1d6   
#### Form  
>Watch with a beautiful leather band and silver face whose hands and numbers move in a seemingly random order   
#### Effect  
> The watch works as a two-way communication device to someone in the past whose level is equal to or less than the artifact level. A screen opens up on the watch face that allows the user to see the person and interact with them. The person isn’t compelled to interact with the user, and the user’s interaction with them doesn’t change anything in the present or future. The connection stays open for ten minutes per artifact level.
