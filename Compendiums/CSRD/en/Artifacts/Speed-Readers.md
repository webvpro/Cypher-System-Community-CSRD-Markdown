## Speed Readers  
  
>1d6  
#### Form  
>Reading glasses with blue-hued lenses   
#### Effect  
>Allows the user to quickly read and understand almost anything within short range, such as a book, long article, important document, and so on, even if itâ€™s not in a language they know. Reading something usually takes at least a few rounds, depending on the length of the item.   
>  
>For the next ten minutes per artifact level, the user remembers everything they read perfectly, and if they take any actions pertaining to that knowledge, their task is eased. At the end of that time, all of their newly gained knowledge disappears. They can only use the speed readers on the same item once.
