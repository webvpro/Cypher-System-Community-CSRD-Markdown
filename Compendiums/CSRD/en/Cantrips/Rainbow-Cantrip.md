## Rainbow Cantrip  (1 Intellect point)  
You create a softly glowing band of colors resembling a rainbow, extending from your hand to an object or willing creature within short range. The far end doesnâ€™t move (a creature could move away from it by going around a corner or out of range). You can anchor your end in place or allow it to move when your hand moves. The rainbow gives off light like a candle and lasts about a minute. Action.
