## Bug Cantrip (1 Intellect point)  
You summon a nearby level 0 spider, cockroach, silverfish, or similar crawling pest to a spot within an immediate distance. The pest acts normally and (appearing in an unfamiliar area) probably begins moving around, possibly crawling on a creature. The cantrip doesnâ€™t work if there are no suitable pests within a short distance. Action.
