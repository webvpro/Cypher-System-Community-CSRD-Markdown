## Clean Cantrip (1 Intellect point)  
You remove dirt, mud, and similar substances from one set of clothing (such as the clothes youâ€™re wearing), about 1 cubic foot of loose material (clothes, curtains, a box of toys, and so on), or an immediate area on a surface (such as a wall or floor). When used on clothing, this also does a decent job of removing wrinkles. Action.
