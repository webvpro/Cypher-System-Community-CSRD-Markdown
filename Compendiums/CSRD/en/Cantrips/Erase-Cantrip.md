## Erase Cantrip  (1 Intellect point)
You erase up to a page of text from a typical surface (such as paper, parchment, wood, or plastic) within immediate range. The writing slowly disappears over a few seconds. Affecting magical writing requires an Intellect-based attack roll. Action. 
>Erase Cantrip doesnâ€™t remove fingerprints, impressions in the paper, or other evidence that writing used to be there.
