## Bee Cantrip (1 Intellect point)
You summon a nearby level 0 bee, housefly, gnat, or similar flying pest to a spot within an immediate distance. The pest acts normally and (appearing in an unfamiliar area) probably begins flying around, possibly landing on a creature. The cantrip doesn’t work if there are no suitable pests within a short distance. Action. 
>[!info]
>A level 0 creature isn’t a threat to a character and is instantly killed if hit. However, tiny creatures like the ones described in the Bee and Bug cantrips usually have a level 2 modifier for Speed defense because of their size.
