## Forbidden Topic Cantrip (1 Intellect point)  
Wards an immediate area (enough to cover a large table at a holiday family gathering) against conversation about a topic of your choice, such as “the election,” “Mommy’s trial,” or “that Cordell kid.” Anytime someone in the area attempts to talk about this topic, make an Intellect-based roll against them; success means they either talk about something else or remain silent. The cantrip lasts for ten minutes or until you fail an Intellect-based roll to stop someone from talking about that topic. Action.
