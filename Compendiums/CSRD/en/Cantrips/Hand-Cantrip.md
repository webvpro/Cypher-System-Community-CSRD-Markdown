## Hand Cantrip (1 Intellect point)  
You levitate or manipulate an object of 10 pounds (4.5 kg) or less at up to a short distance. The effect is not particularly strongâ€”about the same strength as trying to push, pull, or twist something just using the strength of your hand (without your arm). Action.
