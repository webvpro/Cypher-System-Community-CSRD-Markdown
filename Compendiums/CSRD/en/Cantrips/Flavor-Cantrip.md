## Flavor Cantrip (1 Intellect point)  
You touch one plate or bowl of food or one large glass or mug of liquid, improving its flavor. This doesn’t affect the nutritional value or texture, nor does it fix spoiled food; it just makes it taste more to your preference (so you could eat spoiled meat or moldy vegetables and they’d taste fine). You decide the sort of flavor change more or less spicy, salty, savory, sweet, and so on, in any combination appropriate for food or drink. Action.
