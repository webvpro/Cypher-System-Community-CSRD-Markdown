## Chill Cantrip  (1 Intellect point)  
You lower the temperature of a target within short range. If the target is a creature, for the next couple of rounds they feel like they’re standing under an air conditioning vent. If the target is an object no larger than a 1-foot (30 cm) cube, you cool it down as if you’d dunked it into a bucket of ice. Action.
