## Quiet Cantrip  (1 Intellect point)
You muffle the noise from one target within a short distance for a few seconds. Breaking a window or knocking a glass off the table would be no louder than someone tapping their finger on the glass. An obnoxious security alarm would only be as loud as a computer speaker. A ringing phone would be barely audible. If you cast this on a willing creature, they gain an asset on stealth tasks for one round if they move no more than an immediate distance on their turn. Action. 
>Affecting an unwilling creature (or something they’re carrying) with an ability requires an attack roll to succeed. If you’re using a cantrip, by default that attack roll is hindered by two steps
