## Sprout Cantrip  (1 Intellect point)  
You make seeds sprout at an accelerated rate, causing a weekâ€™s worth of growth to happen in just a few moments. The seeds must be within a 1-foot (30 cm) cube and no more than an immediate distance from you. If the seeds are in viable soil, they take root as if planted there. If cast on immature or closed flowers, they bloom. If cast on a piece of unripe fruit, it immediately ripens. Action.
