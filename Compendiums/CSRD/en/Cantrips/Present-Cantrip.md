## Present Cantrip  (1 Intellect point)
You teleport an object within an immediate distance into your upturned hand. The item has to be something youâ€™re carrying (such as a gem in your pouch or a dagger in your boot), something you can see (such as a coffee cup or mobile phone on the other side of the table), or something you know is within range (such as a note you saw someone put in their pocket). The cantrip affects one small object (for example, a cup or mobile phone) or up to a dozen smaller items from the same location (perhaps coins or dice). Action.
