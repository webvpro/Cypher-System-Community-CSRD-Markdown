## Skills and Knowledge Flavor  
This flavor is for characters in roles that call for more knowledge and more real-world application of talent. It's less flashy and dramatic than  supernatural powers or the ability to hack apart multiple foes, but sometimes expertise orknow-how is the real solution to a problem. A Warrior flavored with skills and knowledge might be a military engineer. An Explorer flavored with skills and knowledge could be a field scientist. A Speaker with this flavor might be a teacher.
