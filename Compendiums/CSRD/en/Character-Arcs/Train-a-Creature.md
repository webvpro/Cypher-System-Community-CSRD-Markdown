## Train a Creature  
>You want to domesticate and train an animal or other creature. While the beast doesn’t need to be wild, it must not already be domesticated and trained.  
### Opening: Getting Acquainted    
>You get to know the creature a bit, and it gets to know you.  
### Step: Research    
>You get information on the type of creature or advice from others who have trained one.  
### Step: Domestication    
>After some work, the creature is no longer a threat to you or anyone else, and it can live peacefully in your home or wherever you wish.  
### Step(s): Training    
>Each time you use this step, you teach the creature a new, significant command that it will obey regularly and immediately.  
### Climax: Completion    
>Believing the creature’s training to be complete, you put it in a situation where that is put to the test.   
### Resolution    
>You reflect on the experience.
