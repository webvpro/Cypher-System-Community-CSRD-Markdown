## Solve a Mystery  
>Different from the Learn arc and the Uncover a Secret arc, this arc is about solving a crime or a similar action committed in the fairly recent past. It’s not about practice or study, but about questions and answers. In theory, the mystery doesn’t have to be a crime. It might be “Why is this strange caustic substance leaking into my basement?”  
### Opening: Pledging to Solve the Mystery  
### Step: Research    
>You get some background.  
### Step(s): Investigation    
>You ask questions. You look for clues. You cast divinations. This likely encompasses many such steps.  
### Climax: Discovery    
>You come upon what you believe to be the solution to the mystery.   
### Resolution    
>In this step, which is far more active than most resolutions, you confront the people involved in the mystery with what you’ve discovered, or you use the information in some way (such as taking it to the proper authorities).
