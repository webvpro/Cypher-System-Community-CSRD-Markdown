## Finish a Great Work
>This is an odd character arc in that it’s (presumably) not something that a character would want. It is something that a player selects on a meta level for the character because it makes for an interesting story. It also sets up the potential for future arcs, such as Redemption. It’s important that this involve actions you take. For example, you fall into substance abuse. You treat people badly. You make mistakes that endanger others. In other words, the fall isn’t orchestrated by someone else—it’s all your own doing.
### Opening: The Descent  
>Things go bad.
### Step(s): Further Descent  
>Things get worse. 
>Depending on the situation, this might involve many steps.
### Step: Lashing Out  
>You treat others poorly as you descend.
### Climax: Rock Bottom  
>There is no chance for success here. Only failure.
### Resolution  
>You wallow in your own misery.
