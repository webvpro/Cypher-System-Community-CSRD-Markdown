## Growth  
>Willingly or unwillingly, you are going to change. This is another meta arc. It’s less about a goal and more about character development. While it’s possible that the growth involved is intentional, in most people’s lives and stories, it is emergent. A character might become less selfish, braver, a better leader, or experience some other form of growth.  
### Opening: The Beginning    
>Change usually begins slowly, in a small, almost imperceptible way.  
### Step(s): Change    
>Growth involves many small steps.   
### Step: Overcoming an Obstacle    
>The temptation to resort to your old ways is always present.   
### Climax: Self-Evident Change    
>This is a dramatic about-face. This is the moment where you do something the “old you” would never have done, and it has a profound effect on you and those around you. With either success or failure, growth is possible.  
### Resolution    
>You recognize the change in yourself and move forward.
