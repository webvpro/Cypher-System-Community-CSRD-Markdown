## Assist an Organization  
>Someone close to you or important to you in some way has been wronged. The most overt version of this arc would be to avenge someone’s death. Avenging is different than revenge, as revenge is personal you are the wronged party. But in the Avenge character arc, you are avenging a wrong done to someone else.  
### Opening: Declaration   
>You publicly declare that you are going to avenge the victim(s). This is optional.  
### Step(s): Tracking the Guilty    
>You track down the guilty party. This might not be physically finding them if you already know where they are. Instead, it might be discovering a way to get at them if they are distant, difficult to reach, or well protected. This step might be repeated multiple times, if applicable.  
### Step: Finding the Guilty    
>Finding the Guilty. You finally find the guilty party, or find a path or make a plan to reach them. Now all that’s left is to confront them.   
### Climax : Confrontation  
>You confront the guilty party. This might be a public accusation and demonstration of guilt, a trial, or an attack to kill, wound, or apprehend them—whatever you choose to be appropriate.   
### Resolution    
>You resolve the outcome and the ramifications of the confrontation and decide what to do next.
