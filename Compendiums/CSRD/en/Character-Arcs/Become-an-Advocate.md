## Become an Advocate  
>You desire to help and support others, especially those who are dealing with difficult situations. This might be related to something you’ve personally experienced, something you’re knowledgeable about, or both. You can advocate in any number of ways, including being an emotional support system, helping other voices be heard, defending and safeguarding others’ rights, and generally being an ally.  
  
### Opening: Sizing up Your Skills  
>You decide what best enables you to be a good advocate, and create a plan.  
### Step: Training and Research   
>Building Your Skills. You practice the skills you’ve learned, and review the successes and failures to continue to improve.  
### Step(s): Building a Relationship   
>You assist one or more people through a difficult time using your training, skills, and experience.  
### Climax: Lean on Me   
>You succeed or fail at forging the bond.   
### Resolution   
>You reflect on everything you’ve learned and decide what to do next.
