## Redemption  
>Youâ€™ve done something very wrong, but you want to atone and make it right again. This is like the Justice arc or the Undo a Wrong arc, except you are the wrongdoer. This could be a follow-up to the Fall From Grace arc.  
### Opening: Regret    
>You are determined to rebuild, recover, and restore.  
### Step: Forgiveness    
>You apologize and ask for forgiveness.  
### Step: Identifying the Needs    
>You determine what needs to be done to atone for your transgression.  
### Climax: Making Good    
>You perform an act that you hope will redeem your past misdeed.  
### Resolution    
>You reflect on what has happened but now look to the future.
