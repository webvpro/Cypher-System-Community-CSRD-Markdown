## Develop Coping Strategies  
>You want to develop better ways of moving through the world while living with a mental illness. This isn’t a “cure” or a “fix.” It isa step toward mitigating symptoms or struggles by developing healthy emotional coping strategies.  
  
### Opening:  
>Explore Your Inner Self. You spend time with your emotions and thoughts in order to pinpoint which struggle or symptom you’d like to develop a coping strategy for.  
### Step(s): Make a Plan  
>Almost every struggle or symptom has a particular set of steps that you can go through to better cope with it. This will likely involve research and consultation.  
### Step(s): Practice  
>At every opportunity, practice the coping strategies that you’re learning and pay attention to where they work and fail. You might try different strategies and see which ones seem better suited to your particular needs.  
  
### Climax: Deal With It  
>You’re put into a situation that tests your coping strategies. They don’t have to work perfectly in order for you to succeed.  
  
### Resolution   
>You reflect on what you’ve learned and decide where you want to go from here.
