## Master a Skill
>You’re skilled, but you want to become the best. This arc might logically follow the Learn arc. As with the Learn arc, this can involve any kind of training at all, not just a skill. 
### Opening: Finding the Path  
>You’ve learned the basics. Now it’s time for the advanced material.
### Step: Discovering a Master  
>You find a master to help you become a master.
### Step(s): Learn  
>Depending on what you’re mastering, this could involve one step or quite a few.
### Step: The Last Step  
>Eventually, you realize that even a master cannot teach you the last step. You must learn it on your own.
### Climax: The Test  
>You put your mastery to the test in a real situation—and considering your goal, it’s probably a very important situation.
### Resolution  
>You relax a bit and decide what to do next.
