## Instruction  
>You teach a pupil. You have knowledge on a topic and are willing to share. This can be a skill, an area of lore, a combat style, or the use of a special ability. This is usually a fairly long-term arc. Sometimes teaching a pupil is a side matter, and sometimes the pupil takes on more of an apprentice role and spends a great deal of time with you, traveling with you and perhaps even living in your house (or you living in theirs).  
### Opening: Taking on the Student.  
### Step: Getting to Know Them    
>You assess your pupilâ€™s strengths and weaknesses and try to get an idea of what they need to learn and how you can teach it to them.  
### Step(s): The Lessons    
>Teaching is often a slow, gradual process.  
### Step: Breakdown    
>Many times, a student needs to have a moment of crisis to really learn something. Maybe they get dejected, or maybe they rebel against your teaching techniques.   
### Climax: Graduation    
>This is when you recognize that the pupil has learned what they need. It usually comes at a dramatic moment.   
### Resolution    
>You and the pupil say your goodbyes, and you look toward the future.
