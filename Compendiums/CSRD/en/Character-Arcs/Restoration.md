## Restoration  
>You’re down but not out. You want to restore your good name. Recover what you’ve lost. Rebuild what has been destroyed. You’ve fallen down or have been knocked down, but either way you want to pick yourself up. This is a possible follow-up to the Fall From Grace arc.  
### Opening: Vow to Yourself    
>You are determined to rebuild, recover, and restore.  
### Step(s): Work    
>You rebuild, recover, and restore. If all your money was stolen, you make more. If your house was destroyed, you rebuild it. If your reputation was tarnished, you perform deeds that restore your good name.  
### Climax: The Final Act    
>You undertake one last major task that will bring things back to where they were (or close to it). A lot is riding on this moment.   
### Resolution    
>You enjoy a return to things the way they were before.
