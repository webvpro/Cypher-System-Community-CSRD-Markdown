## Romance  
>You want to strike up a relationship with a romantic partner. Perhaps you have a specific person in mind, or maybe you’re just interested in a relationship in general.  
### Opening(s): Caught Someone’s Eye  
>You meet someone you are interested in. (Since this can be short-lived, it’s possible to have this opening occur more than once.)  
### Step(s): Courtship  
>You begin seeing the person regularly. Although not every “date” is a step in the arc, significant moments are, and there may be a few of them.  
### Climax: Commitment  
>You may or may not be interested in a monogamous relationship. Regardless, you and your love have made some kind of commitment to each other.   
### Resolution: You think about the future  
>Marriage? Children? These are only some of the possibilities.
