## Learn  
>You want to learn something. This isn’t the same as the Uncover a Secret arc, in which you’re looking for a bit of information. This is a skill or whole area of knowledge you want to gain proficiency with. This is learning a new language, how to play an instrument, or how to be a good cook. Thus, it’s not about gaining a level or rank in climbing, but learning to be an experienced mountaineer.  
### Opening: Focusing on the Problem   
### Step: Finding a Teacher or a Way to Teach Yourself    
>Now you can truly begin.  
### Step(s): Learn    
>Depending on what you’re learning, this could involve one step or quite a few.  
### Climax: The Test.   
>You put your new knowledge to the test in a real situation.  
### Resolution    
>You relax a bit and decide what to do next.
