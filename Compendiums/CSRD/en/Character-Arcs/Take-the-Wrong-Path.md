## Take the Wrong Path  
>Much like Fall From Grace, Take the Wrong Path isn’t typically an arc that a character intentionally desires. It’s something the player chooses on a meta level for the character because it makes for an interesting story and sets up possible future arcs, such as Put Down Roots. In this case, perhaps the character manages their anxiety by drinking too much, becoming isolated, or starting too many fights. Perhaps they attempt to deal with grief by overeating (or undereating), by pushing away loved ones, or by becoming intimate with others without regard for their safety.  
  
### Opening: The Fork  
>You take the first steps down the wrong path, even if you don’t know it yet.  
  
### Step: Farther Down the Path  
>Things continue to get worse because of your actions. This may play out over any number of steps.  
### Step(s): Briars and Thorns  
>Your actions hurt yourself and those around you.  
### Climax: Dead End   
>There is no chance for success here. Only failure.  
### Resolution   
>You wallow in your own misery.
