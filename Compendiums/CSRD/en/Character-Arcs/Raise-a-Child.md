## New Discovery  
>You raise a child to adulthood. It can be your biological child or one you adopt. It can even be a child taken under your wing, more a young protégé than a son or daughter. This is obviously a very long-term arc.   
### Opening: Sharing Your Home    
>The child now lives with you.  
### Step: Care and Feeding    
>You learn to meet the child’s basic needs.  
### Step(s): Basic Instruction    
>You teach them to walk, talk, and read. You teach them to care for themselves.  
### Step(s): The Rewards Are Many    
>The child loves you. Relies on you. Trusts you. Eventually, helps you.  
### Step(s): Ethical Instruction    
>You instill your basic ethics in the child, hoping that they will mature into an adult you can be proud of.  
### Climax: Adulthood    
>At some point the child leaves the proverbial nest. You determine, at this point, your own success or failure.  
### Resolution    
>You reflect on the memories you have made.
