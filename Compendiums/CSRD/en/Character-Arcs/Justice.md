## Justice  
>You try to right a wrong or bring a wrongdoer to justice.   
### Opening: Declaration    
>You publicly declare that you are going to bring justice in this situation. This is optional.  
### Step(s): Tracking the Guilty    
>You track down the guilty party, assuming there is one. This might not be physically finding them if you already know where they are. Instead, it might be discovering a way to get at them if they are distant, difficult to reach, or well protected. This step might be repeated multiple times, if applicable.  
### Step: Helping the Victim    
>Righting a wrong does not always involve confronting a wrongdoer. Part of it might be about helping those who were wronged.  
### Climax: Confrontation    
>You confront the guilty party. This might be a public accusation and demonstration of guilt, a trial, or an attack to kill, wound, or apprehend themâ€”whatever you choose to be appropriate.   
### Resolution    
>You resolve the outcome and ramifications of the confrontation and decide what to do next.
