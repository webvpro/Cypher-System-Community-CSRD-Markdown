## Repay a Debt
>You owe someone something, and it’s time to make good.
### Opening: Debts Come Due  
>You determine to do what is needed to make good on the debt. It might involve repaying money, but more appropriately it’s performing a deed or a series of deeds.
### Step: Talking It Over  
>You discuss the matter with the person you owe, if possible. You ensure that what you’re doing is what they want.
### Climax: Repayment  
>Either you do something to earn the money or goods you owe, or you undertake a major task that will compensate the other person. 
### Resolution  
>You relax knowing that your debt is repaid, and you look to the future.
