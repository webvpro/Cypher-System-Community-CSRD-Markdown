## Assist an Organization
>You set out to accomplish something that will further an organization. You’re probably allied with them or they are rewarding you for your help in some fashion.
### Opening: Responding to the Call 
>You work out all the details of what’s expected of you, and what rewards (if any) you might get. You also get the specifics of what’s required to join and advance.
### Step: Sizing up the Task  
>This requires some action. A reconnaissance mission. An investigation. 
### Step(s): Undertaking the Task  
>Because this arc can vary so widely based on the task involved, there might be multiple steps like this one. 
### Climax  
>Completing the Task. 
### Resolution  
>Collecting your reward (if any) and conferring with the people in the organization that you spoke to. Perhaps getting access to higher-ranking people in the organization. You can choose to have your connection to the organization increase rather than take the standard reward.
