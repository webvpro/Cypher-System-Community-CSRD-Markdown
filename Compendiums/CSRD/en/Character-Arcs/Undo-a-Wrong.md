## Undo a Wrong  
>Someone did something horrible, and its ramifications are still felt, even if it happened long ago. You seek to undo the damage, or at least stop it from continuing.  
>  
>This is different from the Justice arc because this isn’t about justice (or even revenge) it’s about literally undoing something bad that happened in the past, such as a great library being burned to the ground, a sovereign people being driven from their land, and so on.  
### Opening: Vowing to Put Right What Once Went Wrong  
### Step: Make a Plan  
>You learn all you can about the situation and then make a plan to put things right.  
### Step(s): Progress  
>This is an active step toward undoing the wrong. It might involve finding something, defeating someone, destroying something, building something, or almost anything else, depending on the circumstances.  
### Climax: Change  
>You face the challenge of the former wrong, and either overcome it or fail.  
### Resolution  
>You reflect on what you’ve accomplished and think about the future.
