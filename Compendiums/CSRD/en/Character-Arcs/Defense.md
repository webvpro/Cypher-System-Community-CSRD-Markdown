### Step: Account for Your Resources   
>How are you going to defend?  
### Step(s): Fend Off Danger  
>The forces threatening what you are protecting probably make an initial threat that you’ll have to defeat. It’s not the main threat, though. There might be multiple such initial threats.

### Resolution   
>A time for reflection on everything that occurred, and an assessment of the person, place, or thing’s safety going forward.
