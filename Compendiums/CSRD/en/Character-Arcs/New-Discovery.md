## New Discovery  
>You want to invent a new device, process, spell, or something similar. A cure for a heretofore unknown disease? An invocation with a result you’ve never heard of before? A method for getting into an impregnable vault? Any of these and more could be your discovery. While similar to the Creation arc and the Learn arc, the New Discovery arc involves blazing a new trail. No one can teach you what you want to know. You’ve got to do it on your own.  
### Opening: The Idea    
>You draw up plans for the thing you want to invent or discover.  
### Step: Research    
>You learn what people have done before and recognize where they fell short.  
### Step(s): Trial and Error    
>You test your hypothesis. This often ends in many failures before you get a success.  
### Climax: Eureka!    
>It’s time to put the discovery to the true test.   
### Resolution    
>You reflect on your discovery and probably compile your notes and write it all down, for posterity’s sake if nothing else.
