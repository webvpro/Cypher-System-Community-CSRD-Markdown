## Acceleration and High-G Maneuver Gm Intrusions Table
|  Roll &nbsp; &nbsp; | Acceleration and High-G Maneuver Gm Intrusions  |
| ------------- | :----------- |
| 1 | After high-G maneuvers, even with amelioration, tissue bruising results, giving the character black eyes, which take a few days to clear. |
| 2 | While under high Gs, a tool or piece of equipment comes loose, accelerates through the craft, and strikes the character, inflicting damage. The bigger the tool and the farther it falls before striking the character, the more damage is inflicted, possibly including being knocked a step down the damage track. |
| 3 | While under high Gs (or afterward), the character suffers minor cardiac problems, likely to grow worse over time (or until medical treatment is sought). |
| 4 | While under high Gs (or afterward), a mild brain aneurysm causes the character to have a sudden headache and blurred vision, which hinders all vision-related tasks until medical treatment is received. |
| 5 | While under high Gs (or afterward), the character begins to have a hard time breathing. The reason is that a lung or lungs have partially collapsed. All tasks are hindered by two steps until the character dies after several hours or until medical treatment is received. |
| 6 | The character has a stroke, and descends two steps on the damage track. They remain debilitated until medical treatment is received |
