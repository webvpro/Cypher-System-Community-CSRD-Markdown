## Salvage From A Spacecraft  
If the derelict ship was subject to vacuum, partly destroyed in combat, or damaged by some other disaster or close encounter with a space hazard, salvaged items are usually degraded, and are valued at one price category less than noted. The GM may decide an object is completely unrecoverable (worthless) or works fine.  
### Salvage GM Intrusion  
>Claim jumpers/pirates might try to salvage a ship that PCs are attempting to salvage.
