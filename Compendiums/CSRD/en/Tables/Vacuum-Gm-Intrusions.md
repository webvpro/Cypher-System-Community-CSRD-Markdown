| d6            | Vacuum Gm Intrusions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 1             | The character notices a crack in their space suit or ship. It's not breached now, but may soon become a serious problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2             | A breach in another part of the ship or space station causes automatic safety pressure baffles to close that section off. A character might be caught in that area of the ship, or in an area of a descending baffle, which inflicts serious damage on the character (these things are made to resist obstructions and form a seal). |
| 3             | A previously unknown crack in a space suit or ship begins to leak. It doesn't cause a blow-out, but unless the crack can be repaired or sealed, those affected will eventually be exposed to vacuum.                                                                                                                                 |
| 4             | A catastrophic blow-out exposes the character or characters to vacuum. It may also send them spiraling out into the void, depending on the situation.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 5             | Vacuum exposure causes the character to projectile vomit, effectively rendering them unable to take an action on their next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6             | Vacuum exposure causes the character to go temporarily blind, which is only relieved a few minutes after normal atmosphere is restored.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
