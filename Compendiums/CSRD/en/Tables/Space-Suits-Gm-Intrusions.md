## Space Suits Gm Intrusions Table
|  Roll &nbsp; &nbsp; | Space Suits Gm Intrusions  |
| ------------- | :----------- |
| 1 | An ill-fitted suit (or one whose auto-fit function is malfunctioning) unexpectedly hinders the character's action |
| 2 | Mechanical joints in the suit freeze unexpectedly, hindering all the character's actions (or completely paralyzing the character) until repairs can be made. |
| 3 | A stuck valve causes the drinking water bulb to get stuck "on" and water begins filling the helmet. This could blind and/or drown the character if not dealt with |
| 4 | Space sickness/a tumble/a spin nauseates the character. If they vomit in their helmet, they are blinded until such time as the helmet can be removed and cleaned. |
| 5 | An electrical short from an external tool or piece of hardware fries the space suit's electronics, limiting communication to helmet-to helmet touch (if in a vacuum where sound doesn't propagate), use of micro thrusters, and limits air supply to just a quarter of what was previously available. |
| 6 | A bloated suit from an overpressure incident hinders all tasks, but is not lethal . . . until the suit won't quite fit back into the airlock. |
