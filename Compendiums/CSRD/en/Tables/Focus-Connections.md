| 1                  | Pick one other PC. For reasons unknown to you, that character is completely immune to your focus abilities, whether you use them for help or for harm.                                                                                                                                               |
| 2                  | Pick one other PC. You knew of that character years ago, but you don't think they knew you.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3                  | Pick one other PC. You're always trying to impress them, but you're not sure why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4                  | Pick one other PC. That character has a habit that annoys you, but you're otherwise quite impressed with their abilities.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 5                  | Pick one other PC. That character shows potential in appreciating your particular paradigm, fighting style, or other focus-provided attribute. You would like to train them, but you're not necessarily qualified to teach (that's up to you), and they might not be interested (that's up to them). |
| 6                  | Pick one other PC. If they are within immediate range when you're in a fight, sometimes they provide an asset, and sometimes they accidentally hinder your attack rolls (50% chance either way, determined per fight).                                                                               |
| 7                  | Pick one other PC. You once saved their life, and they clearly feel indebted to you. You wish they didn't; it's just part of the job.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 8                  | Pick one other PC. That character recently mocked you in some fashion that really hurt your feelings. How you deal with this (if at all) is up to you.                                                                                                                                               |
| 9                  | Pick one other PC. That character knows you have suffered at the hands of robotic entities in the past. Whether you hate robots now is up to you, which may affect your relationship with the character if they are friendly with robots or have robotic parts.                                      |
| 10                 | Pick one other PC. That character comes from the same place you do, and you knew each other as children.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 11                 | Pick one other PC. In the past, they taught you a few tricks to use in a fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 12                 | Pick one other PC. That character doesn't seem to approve of your methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 13                 | Pick one other PC. Long ago, the two of you were on opposite sides of a fight. You won, though you "cheated" in their eyes (but from your perspective, all's fair in a fight). They may be ready for a rematch, though that's up to them.                                                            |
| 14                 | Pick one other PC. You are always trying to impress that character with your skill, wit, appearance, or bravado. Perhaps they are a rival, perhaps you need their respect, or perhaps you're romantically interested in them.                                                                        |
| 15                 | Pick one other PC. You fear that character is jealous of your abilities and worry that it might lead to problems.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 16                 | Pick one other PC. You accidentally caught them in a trap you set, and they had to get free on their own.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 17                 | Pick one other PC. You were once hired to track down someone who was close to that character.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 18                 | Pick two PCs (preferably ones who are likely to get in the way of your attacks). When you miss with an attack and the GM rules that you struck someone other than your target, you hit one of these two characters.                                                                                  |
| 19                 | Pick one other PC. You're not sure how or from where, but that character has a line on bottles of rare alcohol and can get them for you for half price.                                                                                                                                              |
| 20                 | Pick one other PC. You recently had a possession go missing, and you're becoming convinced that they took it. Whether or not they did is up to them.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 21                 | Pick one other PC. They always seem to know where you are, or at least in what direction you are in relation to them.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 22                 | Pick one other PC. Seeing you use your focus abilities seems to trigger an unpleasant memory in that character. That memory is up to the other PC, although they may not be able to consciously recall it.                                                                                           |
| 23                 | Pick one other PC. Something about them interferes with your abilities. When they stand next to you, your focus abilities cost 1 additional point.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 24                 | Pick one other PC. Something about them complements your abilities. When they stand next to you, the first focus ability you use in any 24-hour period costs 2 fewer points.                                                                                                                         |
| 25                 | Pick one other PC. You have known that character for a while, and they helped you gain control of your focus-related abilities.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 26                 | Pick one other PC. Sometime in that character's past, they had a devastating experience while attempting something that you do as a matter of course thanks to your focus. Whether they choose to tell you about it is up to them.                                                                   |
| 27                 | Pick one other PC. Their occasional clumsiness and loud behavior irritate you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 28                 | Pick one other PC. In the recent past, while practicing, you accidentally hit them with an attack, wounding them badly. It is up to them to decide whether they resent or forgive you.                                                                                                               |
| 29                 | Pick one other PC. They owe you a significant amount of money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 30                 | Pick one other PC. In the recent past, while escaping a threat, you accidentally left that character to fend for themselves. They survived, but just barely. It is up to the player of that character to decide whether they resent you or have decided to forgive you.                              |
| 31                 | Pick one other PC. Recently, they accidentally (or perhaps intentionally) put you in a position of danger. You're fine now, but you're wary around them.                                                                                                                                             |
| 32                 | Pick one other PC. From your perspective, they seem nervous around a specific idea, person, or situation. You would like to teach them how to be more comfortable with their fears (if they will let you).                                                                                           |
| 33                 | Pick one other PC. They called you a coward once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 34                 | Pick one other PC. That character always recognizes you or your handiwork, whether you're in disguise or are long gone when they arrive on the scene.                                                                                                                                                |
| 35                 | Pick one other PC. You inadvertently caused an accident that put them into a sleep so deep they didn't wake for three days. Whether they forgive you or not is up to them.                                                                                                                           |
| 36                 | Pick one other PC. You are pretty sure you are related in some fashion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 37                 | Pick one other PC. You accidentally learned something they were trying to keep a secret.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 38                 | Pick one other PC. They are especially sensitive to the use of your flashier focus abilities, and occasionally they become dazzled for a few rounds, which hinders their actions.                                                                                                                    |
| 39                 | Pick one other PC. They appear to have a treasured item that was once yours, but that you lost in a game of chance years ago.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 40                 | Pick one other PC. If it wasn't for you, that character would have failed a past test of mental achievement.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 41                 | Pick one other PC. Based on a couple of comments you've overheard, you suspect that they don't hold your area of training or favorite hobby in the highest regard.                                                                                                                                   |
| 42                 | Pick one other PC whose focus intertwines with yours. This odd connection affects them in some way. For example, if the character uses a weapon, your focus ability sometimes improves their attack in some fashion.                                                                                 |
| 43                 | Pick one other PC. They are deathly afraid of heights. You would like to teach them how to be more comfortable with their feet off the ground. They must decide whether or not to take you up on your offer.                                                                                         |
| 44                 | Pick one other PC. They are skeptical of your claims about something momentous that happened in your past. They might even attempt to discredit you or discover the "secret" behind your story, though that's up to them.                                                                            |
| 45                 | Pick one other PC. They have a knack for being able to recognize where your plans or schemes have a weak spot.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 46                 | Pick one other PC. That character's face is so intriguing to you in a way you don't understand that you sometimes find yourself sketching their likeness in the dirt or using some other medium you have access to.                                                                                  |
| 47                 | Pick one other PC. That character has an extra item of regular equipment you gave them, either something you made or an item you just wanted to give them. (They choose the item.)                                                                                                                   |
| 48                 | Pick one other PC. They commissioned you to do a job for them. You've already been paid but haven't yet completed the job.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 49                 | Pick one other PC. You worked together in the past, and the job ended badly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 50                 | Pick one other PC. While they stand next to you and use their action to concentrate on helping you, one of your focus ability's ranges is doubled.                                                                                                                                                   |
