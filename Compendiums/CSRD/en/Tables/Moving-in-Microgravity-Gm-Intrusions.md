| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1                  | A misjudged jump uses too much force and the character takes damage when they hit an unexpected bulkhead or other obstruction, or too little force, leaving them stranded in the middle of an open area                                                                                    |
| 2                  | A misjudged jump in microgravity causes the character to strike an important control surface that sets off a secondary issue, causes the character to jump to a dangerous location, or causes their tether (apparently previously abraded) to snap and send them spiraling out into space. |
| 3                  | A tool, weapon, or other piece of equipment--even one that should have a tether or magnetic clamp-- dislodges and floats away.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 4                  | A mishap causes the character to spin wildly, hindering all tasks by two steps from disorientation and nausea. Without outside aid, micro thrusters, or some other useful strategy, stopping a spin is difficult.                                                                          |
| 5                  | An ally accidentally jostles the character, and they are sent on an unexpected trajectory as if they had misjudged a jump.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 6                  | When attempting to grab a resisting target or panicking ally, or after some kind unexpected shake or violent ship maneuver, the character is sent on an unexpected trajectory as if they had misjudged a jump.                                                                             |
