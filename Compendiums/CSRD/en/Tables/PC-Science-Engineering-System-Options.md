## Player Science & Engineering System Options

| Science and Engineering Task | Hindrance | Effect on Target Craft (or on PC’s craft)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scan                         | –         | Gain basic information, such as whether other ships are in the area, if such ships are in yet within combat range, if reinforcements might be in the offing, and so on                                                                                                                                                        |
| Tactical scan               | One step  | Learn the level of identified enemy spacecraft                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Deep scan                    | Two steps | Enemy spacecraft weakness discovered, next task chosen by this character for another PC is eased (usually a piloting or weapons task)                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Jam/Hack                     | Two steps | Requires three success before two failures (thus a minimum of three rounds); if successful, enemy ship takes no actions for a couple of rounds until they regain control by severing the communications link; during this time, all tasks against enemy craft are eased by two steps                                          |
| Open communications           | Two steps | Attempt to parlay; at the very least, success causes the enemy spacecraft to delay at least one round, which could be the end of it, or open further dialouge                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Reconfigure station          | –         | Changes the system that the station controls. Useful when another station is damaged or the PC crewing another station is disabled; reconfiguration locks out options from whatever system is previously controlled unless reconfigured again; can be done as part of another action                                          |
| Effect repair                | –         | Sometimes a character can repair a subsystem from their station, but repair may require moving to another part of the ship, such as the drive chamber, the compartment where weapons are sleeved, or even onto the outer hull. The difficulty is equal to the modified difficulty of the enemy craft that caused the damage.  |
| Redline science/engineering  | –         | Reverse polarity on the sensors, dig up some bizarre lore from a database that could change the situation somehow, make the hull reflective, or some other risky gambit                                                                                                                                                       |
