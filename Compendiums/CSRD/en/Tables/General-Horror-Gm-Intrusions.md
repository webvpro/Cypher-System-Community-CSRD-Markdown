|  Roll &nbsp; &nbsp; | General Horror Gm Intrusions  |  
| ------------- | :----------- |  
| 1 | Something foils a character's attempt to escape: a getaway car won't start, they drop the keys that unlock the exit door or lock up the villain, or the shotgun they're using to clear a path jams or runs out of shells. |  
| 2 | The antagonist enters a secure or sealed room by an unexpected method: crashing through a door or wall, crawling out of a ventilation shaft, jumping out of a trap door, manifesting electronically through a Wi-Fi signal, or teleporting. |  
| 3 | A mysterious noise nearby amplifies the tension, and when investigated reveals itself to be ... a cat, either perfectly calm or hissing and leaping. This often allows for a momentary de-escalation followed by a real scare, such as the antagonist reaching out of the darkness to grab a character. |  
| 4 | A dramatic and/or ridiculous amount of blood and gore from something that just got killed splashes on a character, blinding them until they take an action to wipe their eyes clean. |
