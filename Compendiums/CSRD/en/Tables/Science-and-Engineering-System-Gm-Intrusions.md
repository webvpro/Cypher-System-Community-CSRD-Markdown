| Roll &nbsp; &nbsp; | Science and Engineering System Gm Intrusions                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1                  | Shields (or basic hull integrity) compromised, all ship defense tasks hindered this round.                                                                                                                  |
| 2                  | Sensors compromised, all spacecraft tasks hindered this round.                                                                                                                                              |
| 3                  | Shields (or basic hull integrity) seriously compromised, all ship defense tasks hindered until repair is completed.                                                                                         |
| 4                  | Station malfunctions, sparking with electrical feedback, damaging PC. Requires repair until station will function again.                                                                                    |
| 5                  | Sensors seriously compromised, hindering all piloting and weapons task by two steps until repaired.                                                                                                         |
| 6                  | Hull integrity breached, atmosphere begins to vent, and possibly one or two crew too near the hole are at risk of being sucked out. Unless repaired, ship atmosphere is lost to space within a few minutes. |
