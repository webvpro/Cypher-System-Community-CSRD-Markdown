## Spacecraft Gm Intrusions Table
|  Roll &nbsp; &nbsp; | Spacecraft Gm Intrusions  |
| ------------- | :----------- |
| 1 | Spacecraft is holed by micrometeorite or other debris and begins to leak air |
| 2 | Spacecraft power source unexpectedly stutters, runs out of fuel, or malfunctions in a way that could lead to detonation. |
| 3 | Spacecraft is holed by something large enough to risk a catastrophic blow-out. |
| 4 | Environmental controls malfunction; ship interior grows colder and colder (causing a buildup of frost and ice on interior surfaces), until the problem can be identified and repaired. |
| 5 | Drive system surges, causing the vehicle to move faster, farther, or to a different location than was intended. |
| 6 | Solar flare, gravitational gradient, or other understood but unexpected phenomena damages ship. |
| 7 | A malfunction, deliberate sabotage by a rival, or a fatal malware-infected shipmind affects the environmental controls in a space suit or entire ship, deoxygenating it until it's mostly carbon dioxide. Affected characters, initially unaware of the problem, become more and more sleepy until they pass out. |
| 8 | Gamma ray burst from "nearby" neutron star conjunction threatens to fry ship and everyone on board. |
| 9 | External operations lead to a character being bucked off craft into empty space. |
| 10 | Environmental systems are compromised, requiring extensive overhaul to return to normal. |
