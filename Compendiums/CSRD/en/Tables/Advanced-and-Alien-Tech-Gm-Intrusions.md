## Advanced and Alien Tech Gm Intrusions Table  
| Roll &nbsp; &nbsp; | Advanced and Alien Tech Gm Intrusions                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1                  | Ooze sprays the character, then hardens, trapping them until they can escape a level 4 "shell."                                                                            |
| 2                  | Device becomes stuck in midair, immovable as if caught in invisible, otherwise intangible cement.                                                                          |
| 3                  | Device grows increasingly hot over the course of one minute, then fuses into a nonfunctional lump.                                                                         |
| 4                  | Device shoots like a bullet in a random direction for a long distance, lodging itself in a structure or tree.                                                              |
| 5                  | Very bright light flashes from the device, blinding the PC for a few minutes.                                                                                              |
| 6                  | A blue light on the device begins flashing; if device is not destroyed, an alien enthraller investigates.                                                                  |
| 7                  | Device function is triggered, as are any other devices (cyphers and/or artifacts) the PC carries.                                                                          |
| 8                  | Mutagenic energy pulse; character develops a distinctive mutation over the course of ten hours.                                                                            |
| 9                  | Device breaks in half (becoming nonfunctional) and spills some sort of grey goo on the character.                                                                          |
| 10                 | Device detonates, inflicting damage equal to its level on everything within short range on a failed Speed defense roll, or 2 points of damage even with a successful roll. |
