| 1                  | Space sickness happens to everyone eventually. Nauseated characters are hindered in all tasks and may vomit unexpectedly.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2                  | A wrist bone, thinner than it should be due to long-term exposure to microgravity, breaks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3                  | Upon return to full gravity after a long period in zero G or low G, the character stands up and then passes out. (This "orthostatic intolerance" fades in a few hours.)                                                                                                                                    |
| 4                  | Vision becomes distorted because the character's eyes literally take on a new shape in zero G, all vision-related tasks are hindered                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5                  | Despite precautions, sometimes viruses infect a character. The common cold virus is, ridiculously enough, still not preventable in advanced settings, and if anything, has even more severe symptoms for those in microgravity. The character descends one step on the damage track until they get better. |
| 6                  | The character is diagnosed with cancer. Depending on the tech setting, it is amenable to medical intervention (or at least long-term treatment to keep symptoms controlled), if that intervention comes soon enough.                                                                                       |
