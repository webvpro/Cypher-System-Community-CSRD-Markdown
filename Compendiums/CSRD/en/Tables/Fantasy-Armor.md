>\* Only against piercing and slashing attacks 
>** Using a shield provides the wearer with an asset on Speed defense tasks If the GM prefers the simpler method of not tracking whether an attack is bashing, slashing, or stabbing, heavy cloth and padded armor should provide no Armor at all.

>[!example] Shields
Shields provide an asset to Speed defense rolls. You must have one free hand to use a shield.
