## Fantastic Threats and Hazards Table
|  Roll &nbsp; &nbsp; | Fantastic Threats and Hazards  |
| ------------- | :----------- |
| 1 | Hallucinatory flowers (level 3): The ground floor of the ruin hosts a handful of purplish flowers growing up out of the rubble. A character who gets a puff of the pollen hallucinates their allies are actually cannibals trying to eat the affected character each round until the character succeeds on a Might defense roll. |
| 2 | AI instance, minor (level 3): An artificial intelligence in an old facility attempts to install itself in the wetware (the brain) of humans and any other nearby sapient creatures. Anyone within immediate range of a video screen playing carefully crafted symbols and sounds who fails an Intellect defense roll is stunned, losing their next turn as they stare in rapt attention. If they fail a subsequent defense roll, they come under the control of the AI for one minute, or until they succeed on an Intellect defense roll on their turn. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI's goals. |
| 3-4 | Voracious cockroach swarm (level 3): This swarm, easily covering an area a short distance in diameter, doesn't shrink from the light or from people. Indeed, it seems eerily intelligent, and if threatened, it attacks, inflicting 3 points of damage each round on everything in its area that fails a Speed defense roll, or 1 point on a successful roll. |
| 5 | Animate vegetation (level 4): Kudzu got a lot worse in the aftermath. Characters that fail a Speed defense roll take 4 points of damage each round from strangulation and vine constriction until they can escape |
| 6 | Ashy tide (level 4): A series of powerful wind gusts in the area kicks up a lot of fine grey ash. Except it's not ash--it's a collection of nanobots, each the size of a grain of sand or smaller, called ashy tide. |
| 7-8 | Glowing roach infestation: Four to ten glowing roaches the size of dogs have truly come into their own now that they've grown in stature and intelligence. They have little use for survivors, except as food. |
| 9 | Psychic lichen (level 4): Psychic lichen gently attacks the minds of nearby creatures, causing them to grow tired and nap if they fail an Intellect defense roll. If not awakened, the dozing body serves as food for a new psychic lichen colony. |
| 10 | Strike from the heavens (level 4): A before-times war satellite becomes active and fires a focused microwave beam at the PCs in the area, inflicting 4 points of damage each round they remain in the area without solid cover and fail a Might defense roll, or 2 points on a successful roll. |
| 11 | Abomination lair: The abomination was a person once, or its ancestors were. Not anymore. |
| 12 | Fiery fissure (level 5): A crack splinters the ground along a newly forming fire-filled fissure that stretches a long distance, zigging and zagging to catch several more targets than it might otherwise. PCs who fail a Speed defense roll fall in and are burned for 5 points of damage each round until they can climb out or be pulled out with a successful Might task as an action. |
| 13 | Glowing tide (level 5): Veins of yellow-gold light branching across surfaces (roads, buildings, and bare earth) indicate that nanites are probably active, creating a dangerous area of glowing tide. |
| 14 | Time anomaly (level 5): The PCs encounter a wall of golden light whose interior ripples with lightning. It's a time storm, and either it blocks the PCs' path, or worse, it's gradually sweeping toward the characters. |
| 15 | AI instance, major (level 6): An artificial intelligence in a powered facility attempts to install itself in the wetware (the brain) of humans and any other nearby sapient creatures. Anyone within immediate range of a video screen playing carefully crafted symbols and sounds who fails an Intellect defense roll is stunned, losing their next turn as they stare in rapt attention. If they fail a subsequent defense roll, they come under the control of the AI (because an instance of the AI is running in their head). A target can make a new Intellect defense roll each day to try to reject the control. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI's goals. |
| 16 | Hungry tide (level 6): A greyish-green mist of nanobots a short distance in diameter drifts in the wind, until the hungry tide senses living organisms and moves a short distance each round toward them. |
| 17 | Quantum singularity (level 6): Attempts to change the past to avert the apocalypse have consequences, including these points of unstable space-time. Characters who fail an Intellect defense task are teleported a short distance in a random direction and possibly several hours forward in time. |
| 18-19 | Rampaging wardroid (level 6): Wardroids may be what caused the apocalypse in the first place; whatever the case, one has wandered directly into the PCs' path. |
| 20 | Mutant bear: The house-sized radioactive bear, whose roar can be heard for miles, is something to avoid. |
