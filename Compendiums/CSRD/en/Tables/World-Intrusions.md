## World Intrusions Table
|  Roll &nbsp; &nbsp; | World Intrusions  |
| ------------- | :----------- |
| 1 | One or more characters accidentally damage or offend a plant of some type, causing it to retaliate. |
| 2 | A wren starts singing at a nearby crossroads, warning that something's coming. |
| 3 | One of the characters trips and falls into a rabbit hole. |
| 4 | Someone steals the moon just as the PCs are about to do an important task that requires moonlight. |
| 5 | The tree that the characters are sitting under wakes up. Perhaps it is hungry, or maybe it just wants company. |
| 6 | The path that the characters have been following turns into a rushing river beneath their feet. |
| 7 | Someone casting a curse nearby accidentally catches one of the characters in the magic, causing them to be affected (roll on the Curse table to determine the effect). |
| 8 | A mountain rises up suddenly between the place where the characters stand and the place they need to get to. |
| 9 | Somewhere far off, a magical effect backfires, causing a stampede of wild animals to run right toward the characters. |
| 10 | One of the characters smells gingerbread. The scent is so tempting, they have a hard time turning away from it. |
