## Player Piloting System Options

| Piloting Task       | Hindrance   | Effect on Target Craft                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Evasive maneuvers   | One step    | Defenses eased three steps, but attacks this round hindered by the same amount                                                                                       |
| Increase separation | One step    | Defenses eased one step, attacks hindered by one step, but creates chance to lose enemy aircraft (see below)                                                         |
| Decrease separation | –           | Negates chance of losing enemy craft this round                                                                                                                      |
| Stealth approach    | Three steps | So long as no attack is made, pilot’s craft can ‘snug’ up to much larger enemy craft and hide from its sensors                                                       |
| Lose enemy craft    | Four steps  | If separation is first increased as a separate task (or maneuverability is disabled), target craft loses track of pilot’s craft behind a moon, in a debris belt, etc |
| Study enemy flying  | –           | Spend one round watching enemy tactics, the next piloting task is eased                                                                                              |
| Fly in formation    | –           | If another allied ship is part of the combat, coordinate with it, providing that ship an asset in its next piloting task                                             |
| Redline maneuver    | –           | Spinning, flying through a dangerous region, or some other gamble                                                                                                    |
