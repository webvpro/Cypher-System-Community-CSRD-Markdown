## Gm Intrusions for Post-Apocalyptic Games Table
|  Roll &nbsp; &nbsp; | Gm Intrusions for Post-Apocalyptic Games  |
| ------------- | :----------- |
| 1-2 | (group): Roll on the preceding Realistic Threats and Hazards table, or on the Fantastic Threats and Hazards table if your game includes fantastic elements. |
| 4 | disease that drops them one step on the damage track each day they fail a Might defense roll. |
| 5-6 | (group or character): The PCs' mode of transport breaks (or someone's boot heel snaps off), requiring about an hour of repair, possibly meaning that they have to duck into nearby ruins to find parts. |
| 9-10 | (group): The PCs discover their food and water supplies have become contaminated with poisonous mold or dangerous levels of radiation (level 4). |
| 11-12 | (group): An unseasonal blizzard forces the PCs to seek shelter in an abandoned train yard, which shows signs of being claimed by another group of survivors. |
| 5 | Might task to pull free. |
| 3 | points of Speed damage (ignores Armor), and on a failed difficulty 3 Might defense roll, the character develops one harmful mutation. Each day the PC can attempt another Might defense roll; with a success, the mutation subsides. |
| 17-18 | (group): A wildfire or structural fire (level 5) moves through the area; PCs must run before it to survive. However, when the fire has burnt out several hours later, the PCs are lost. |
| 19-20 | (group): A sinkhole opens beneath the PCs' vehicle, which becomes hopelessly stuck in loose earth until they can succeed on a difficulty 7 Might roll to push it out. If PCs don't have a vehicle, the sinkhole sucks down one character and threatens to smother them unless the others succeed on a difficulty 7 Might roll to extract them. |
| 23-24 | (group): High winds, acidic precipitation, or a drift of grey goo eats through the PCs' shelter's roof. |
| 27-28 | (group): Yellow mushrooms with black speckles (level 4) grow profusely in the area and ooze weirdly blood-like fluid when brushed or trod upon, or simply as PCs pass by. The mushrooms are poisonous, inflicting 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) if ingested, but they also grant PCs a one-time asset on any knowledge tasks they attempt during the next ten hours. |
| 29-30 | (group): That buzzing noise that's been getting louder and louder is revealed as a swarm of aggressive, stinging radioactive bees. Radioactive bees, swarm: level 5; stings inflict 6 damage and, on failed Might defense roll, an allergic reaction dealing 1 Speed damage (ignores Armor) each minute until target is tended |
| 31-32 | (group): The PCs enter a region threatened by pockets of explosive gas (level 5), visible before they detonate as low-lying banks of thin, yellowish mist. If agitated, a gas pocket detonates, inflicting 5 points of damage on everything in the area, or 2 points on PCs who succeed on a Speed defense roll. |
| 4 | Speed defense roll. |
| 35-36 | (group): A before-times radio transmission is received, asking anyone, anywhere, for aid. |
| 37-38 | (group): Mosquitos the size of hummingbirds attack. Mosquitos, giant, swarm: level 3; bite inflicts damage and, on failed Might defense roll, target contracts Nipah |
| 6 | points of damage and is caught in a painful clamp until an ally succeeds on a difficulty 6 Might task to remove it. |
| 45-46 | (group): A mushroom cloud from a nuclear detonation blooms on the horizon. Are the PCs far enough away to survive? Maybe, if they find shelter pronto. |
| 49-50 | (group): The PCs encounter a survivor claiming to be looking for a source of water that's not radioactive. Maybe they're telling the truth and could use some help. Or maybe they're a spy from a nearby raider camp. |
| 5 | points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) and are stunned, losing their next turn. |
| 55-56 | (group): When the PCs return to their camp or place of refuge, they find that someone else has stolen all their carefully hoarded stores and wrecked part of the camp. |
| 57-58 | (group): A pack of seven rabid dogs appears, growling and snarling. Rabid dog: level 3, attacks as level 4; Armor 1 59-60: The character falls partly (or completely) through the rotting floor, trapping their foot until they succeed on a difficulty 4 Might roll, or dropping them to a lower floor (and separating them from the others). |
| 61-62 | (group): It's hot outside today, due to a combination of aberrant weather conditions. PCs without some means of cooling themselves off suffer 1 point of ambient damage each minute in the "heat dome" covering the region. |
| 63-64 | (group): Eroded earth and dead vegetation in the region create perfect conditions for a sandstorm, which blows through the area for several hours, reducing visibility to an immediate distance. |
| 65-66 | (group): An electromagnetic storm rips through the area, knocking out any electronic devices the PCs might have, and potentially threatening PCs without shelter with a lightning strike (level 7). |
| 10 | points of damage (or 3 points even with a successful Speed defense roll). |
| 69-70 | (group): A group of three to six zombies (or cannibals, if your game has no zombies) stumbles out of the hospital, bunker, or old military facility. |
| 73-74 | (group): Seeping gas (level 4) in the area causes the PCs to begin hallucinating. Each is certain the other is some kind of threat--such as a raider, a zombie, or something else dangerous--until they succeed on a difficulty 3 Intellect defense roll on their turn to realize what's going on. |
| 75-76 | (group): The characters are caught in a stampede of rewilded giraffes, elephants, buffalo, or other large animals. Each PC suffers 3 points of damage, descends one step on the damage track, and on a failed difficulty 3 Speed defense roll, is borne along for a while and separated from their allies. |
| 77-78 | (group): The heavy rain and lightning storm suddenly births a tornado. PCs must seek shelter or suffer 7 points of damage each round they are exposed. If a PC takes enough damage to descend three steps on the damage track, they are pulled up into the vortex and lost. |
| 81-82 | (group): A before-times jet appears in the sky, engines spewing smoke, before it crashes close enough to deal 4 points of damage to PCs that fail a difficulty 4 Speed defense roll. |
| 83-84 | (group): It begins to hail ice chunks the size of golf balls, inflicting 3 points of damage each round on PCs without shelter. The event also knocks any exposed vehicles or shelter the PCs rely on one step down the object damage track. |
| 89-90 | (group): A group of people (level 2) with glazed eyes appear with gifts of food. They want to introduce the PCs to their AI benefactor (or warlord, if your game has no AIs) via an old-time communications device they have with them. |
| 97-98 | (group): NPC survivors demand PCs pay a toll to pass, equal to enough food and water to sustain one person for five days. |
| 99-100 | (group): The PCs arrive, but apparently their directions were wrong, because they're not where they wanted to go, but someplace completely different. |
| 1 | An insect stings or bites the character at just the wrong moment. |
| 2 | Something in the area makes the character sneeze loudly and repeatedly. |
| 3 | The character shimmers in and out of view. |
| 4 | A deep sense of despair comes over the character. |
| 5 | The character feels an overwhelming urge to start dancing. |
| 6 | The character's clothes are suddenly much too large. |
