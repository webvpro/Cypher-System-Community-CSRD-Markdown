| 1-3                | Blocked road: The road ahead is so filled with abandoned, rusted before-times vehicles that the PCs must walk if they want to take that route. Walkers are unable to see more than an immediate distance in any direction between the cars. If PCs have a vehicle larger than a bicycle, they'll have to find another way or leave it behind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 4-6                | Setting-specific element: Choose a hazard from a set piece or optional rule you're using, or if you want to shake things up, roll on the Fantastic Threats and Hazards table. Or just choose the next result on this table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 7-10               | Angry ants (level 2): Thousands of biting ants pour from cracks in the pavement, attacking everything in an immediate area, inflicting 2 points of damage if they hit a target and, on a failed Might defense roll, dazing targets with pain for one round. Even if a target succeeds on its initial Speed defense roll, it takes 1 point of damage because the ants are everywhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 11-14              | Enraged wasps (level 3): This wasp swarm acts as a single level 3 creature whose stinging attacks ignore Armor. Attacks on the swarm that don't deal area damage inflict only 1 point of damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 15-17              | Cannibal convoy: A before-times RV pulls up. It's the current property of a group of four to ten people who make the biofuel the vehicle runs on. They seem nice, but they're actually cannibals thinking of inviting the PCs for dinner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 18-20              | Earthquake, minor (level 3): The ground within long range of an epicenter heaves and shakes for one or more minutes. Each round, creatures in the area take either 3 points of damage due to the general shaking on a failed Speed defense roll, or 6 points of damage if they are in or adjacent to a structure or terrain feature shedding debris on a failed Speed defense roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

(The avalanche could be debris or rubble instead of snow.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 73-75              | Dilapidated infrastructure, major (level 5): The building, underpass tunnel, or cave collapses, or the bridge over which the vehicle is passing crumbles. Characters suffer 5 points of damage, and on a failed difficulty 5 Speed task are buried under suffocating rubble until they can escape or are rescued. For additional danger, treat as an unstable structure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 76-78              | Disease (level 5+): Even if the world didn't end because of a pandemic, disease threatens the PCs when they meet a group of especially unlucky (and diseased) survivors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 79-80              | Flooded region (level 5): A failed Speed defense roll means the rushing waters envelop the character, inflicting 5 points of damage and moving them a short distance in the direction of the water's flow. A serious flood could further endanger the character.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 81                 | Firenado (level 5): Fire generates a vortex of flame and smoke, creating a rotating column of air that draws in flames and debris, resulting in a powerful whirlwind of fire. The vortex moves an immediate distance (on a roll of 1-3 on a d6) or a short distance (on a roll of 4-6 on a d6) each round in a random direction, persisting for 1d6 + 2 rounds before dispersing. Anyone intersected by the firenado's immediate-radius area takes 5 points of damage each round on a failed Speed defense roll. The PC must also succeed on a Might defense roll or be pulled up into the firenado, burned for another 5 points of damage, and hurled in a random direction a short distance, which inflicts another 5 points of damage from falling and/or impacting other structures. 82-84 Poisoned waters, major (level 5): Drinking this slightly glowing water inflicts 5 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task, and merely getting wet inflicts 3 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task. |
| 85-86              | Just a bear, but a big one: A regular grizzly bear is always frightening, before or after the end. Grizzly bear: level 5; health 20; Armor 1 * War pig: level 3; rider has asset on melee attacks, or pig can make a separate tusk attack when rider attacks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 87-88              | Nuclear fallout (level 5): Radioactive dust drifts to the ground or precipitates out as rain. PCs in the area suffer 1 point of ambient damage each minute, and if they remain for an hour or longer, they're subject to radiation sickness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
