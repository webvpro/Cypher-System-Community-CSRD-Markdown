## Resurrection
Restores a dead being to life. The creature is restored to full health and is ready to act as soon as the ritual is completed. Depending on how they died and the nature of death in the setting, the creature may or may not remember anything that happened after they died. 
### Level 
>The level of the deceased (at least tier 6 if a PC) 
### Time 
>Five hours of preparation, two hours of performance 
### Roles 
>Applying reagents, chanting, prayers, shielding the corpse from hostile entities 
### Side Effects 
>Creature moves a step down the damage track, enmity of a death god, lasting damage, scarring, sympathetic damage 
### Reagents 
>Deceased’s corpse, healing ointment, items of emotional significance (such as devotion, hope, or regret), items of importance to the deceased, parchment extolling the deceased’s history and deeds, soul-sympathetic items 
### Pool 
>Might or Intellect 
### Other Assets 
>Close relationship with the deceased (such as a connection or family relation), healing magic, necromancy, spirit knowledge, secret name of the deceased

A lesser version of the Resurrection ritual might bring the creature back to life, but only to the debilitated or impaired state on the damage track instead of hale, requiring further rest or healing.
