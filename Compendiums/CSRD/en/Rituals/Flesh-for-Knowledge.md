## Exorcism  
Sacrifices some of the ritualist’s flesh, inflicting Might and Speed damage equal to the level of the ritual and permanently reducing the character’s Pools by 4 points (the character can divide this loss between Might and Speed as they see fit). The character experiences painful hallucinations that give them insight and understanding. They immediately learn one type or focus ability available to them (any ability they could learn by spending 4 XP as an advancement).   
### Level   
>Twice the tier of the ability the character wishes to learn   
### Time   
>One hour of preparation, one hour of performance   
### Roles   
>Chanting, restraining the subject of the ritual   
### Side Effects   
>Lasting damage, permanent damage, scarring   
###  Reagents   
>Silver knife, silver vessel   
### Pool   
>See above   
### Other Assets   
>Pain tolerance, surgery   
  
Instead of permanently reducing a character’s Pools by 4 points, the GM could allow other permanent penalties such as reducing an Edge stat by 1 (to a minimum of 0), gaining an inability in a useful skill, or permanently reducing all points gained through recovery rolls by 2.
