## Beseech
Call upon a powerful supernatural entity such as a deity, archangel, demon lord, or ancient elemental to ask for a favor that the entity can and is likely to do (nothing it would ethically oppose). If the ritual is successful, the entity makes its attention known, such as by manifesting as a light, noise, or visible spirit. It may ask for more information, for a task or favor in return, or for a service to be named later. The entity is not compelled to do the favor; the ritual merely gains its attention and gives the characters the opportunity to speak their case. 

### Level 
>The level of the entity 
### Time 
>Four hours of preparation, one hour of performance 
### Roles  
>Chanting, lighting candles, holding gifts/reagents 
### Side Effects  
>Curse, hallucination, prerequisite quest (a challenge or task the characters must perform before the entity will consider answering) 
### Reagents  
>Scroll giving the history of and important details about the entity, offerings of gratitude or appeasement 
### Pool 
>Might or Intellect 
### Other Assets 
>Knowledge or control of similar entities

Beseech only draws the entity’s attention; the various Conjure rituals bring the summoned entity bodily to the ritual space to talk in person.
