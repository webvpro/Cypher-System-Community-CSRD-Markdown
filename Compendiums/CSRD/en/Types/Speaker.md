You’re good with words and good with people. You talk your way past challenges and out of jams, and you get people to do what you want.

>**Individual Role**: Speakers are smart and charismatic. They like people and, more important, they understand them. This helps speakers get others to do what needs to be done.

>**Group Role**: The Speaker is often the face of the group, serving as the person who speaks for all and negotiates with others. Combat and action are not a Speaker’s strong suits, so other characters sometimes have to defend the Speaker in times of danger.

>**Societal Role**: Speakers are frequently political or religious leaders. Just as often, however, they are con artists or criminals.

>**Advanced Speakers**: Higher-tier speakers use their abilities to control and manipulate people as well as aid and nurture their friends. They can talk their way out of danger and even use their words as weapons.

## Speaker Player Intrusions

When playing a Speaker, you can spend 1 XP to use one of the following player intrusions, provided the situation is appropriate and the GM agrees.

>**Friendly NPC**: An NPC you don’t know, someone you don’t know that well, or someone you know but who hasn’t been particularly friendly in the past chooses to help you, though doesn’t necessarily explain why. Maybe they’ll ask you for a favor in return afterward, depending on how much trouble they go to.

>**Perfect Suggestion**: A follower or other already-friendly NPC suggests a course of action with regard to an urgent question, problem, or obstacle you’re facing.

>**Unexpected Gift**: An NPC hands you a physical gift you were not expecting, one that helps put the situation at ease if things seem strained, or provides you with a new insight for understanding the context of the situation if there’s something you’re failing to understand or grasp.

>[!tip]+ Speaker Stat Pools  
>|Stat|Pool Starting Value|
|---|---|
|[[Might]]|8|
|[[Speed]]|9|
|[[Intellect]]|11|

You get 6 additional points to divide among your stat Pools however you wish.

#### Speaker Background Connection

Your type helps determine the connection you have to the setting. Roll a d20 or choose from the following list to determine a specific fact about your background that provides a connection to the rest of the world. You can also create your own fact.

> |1d20|Background|
|---|---|
|1|One of your parents was a famous entertainer in their early years and hoped you would excel in the same medium.|

## Speaker Example

Mary wants to create a Speaker for a Lovecraftian horror campaign. She puts 3 of her additional stat points into her Intellect Pool and 3 into her Speed Pool; her stat Pools are now Might 8, Speed 12, and Intellect 14. As a first-tier character, her Effort is 1, her Might Edge and Speed Edge are 0, and her Intellect Edge is 1. She’s smart and charismatic but not particularly tough.

Mary chooses [[Fast|Fast]] and Spin Identity to help get into places and learn things she wants to know. She’s a bit of a con artist. She’s good to her friends, however, and chooses [[Encouragement|Encouragement]] as well. Mary rounds out her first-tier abilities with Interaction Skills (deceiving and persuasion).

A Speaker normally starts with two cyphers, but the GM rules that characters in this campaign start with only one—something creepy relating to their background. Mary’s cypher is an odd pocket watch given to her by her grandfather. She doesn’t know how or why, but when activated, the watch allows her to take twice as many actions for three rounds.

Mary’s character carries a small knife hidden in her bag in case of trouble. As a light weapon, it inflicts 2 points of damage, but attacks with it are eased.

Mary chooses [[Resilient|Resilient]] for her descriptor and decides that she can probably learn the truth behind some of the strange things that she’s heard about without feeling too much trauma if it’s horrible. Resilient increases her Might Pool to 10 and her Intellect Pool to 16. She’s trained in Might and Intellect defense actions and gains an extra recovery roll each day. At first, Mary is sad that her descriptor gives her an inability in knowledge and puzzle tasks, but then she realizes that the flaw fits her character well—she’s better at getting people to tell her what she needs to know than at figuring out the information herself.

For her focus, Mary chooses Moves Like a Cat, granting her a final Speed Pool of 18 and training in [[Balance|Balance]]. In the end, she’s graceful and quick, charismatic, and hardier than she initially thought thanks to her drive. She’s ready to investigate the weird.

For her character arc, Mary chooses Fall From Grace. She decides she’s had an obsession with a strange tome that’s been in her family for generations, and her character is drawn to its strange languages and rituals.
