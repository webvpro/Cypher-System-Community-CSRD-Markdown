You master powers or abilities outside the experience, understanding, and sometimes belief of others. They might be magic, psychic powers, mutant abilities, or just a wide variety of intricate devices, depending on the setting. (“Magic” here is a term used very loosely. It’s a catch-all for the kinds of wondrous, possibly supernatural things that your character can do that others cannot. It might actually be an expression of technological devices, channeling spirits, mutations, psionics, nanotechnology, or any number of other sources.)    
>**Individual Role:** Adepts are usually thoughtful, intelligent types. They often think carefully before acting and rely heavily on their supernatural abilities.    
  
>**Group Role:** Adepts are not powerful in straightforward combat, although they often wield abilities that provide excellent combat support, both offensively and defensively. They sometimes possess abilities that facilitate overcoming challenges. For example, if the group must get through a locked door, an Adept might be able to destroy it or teleport everyone to the other side.     
  
>**Societal Role:** In settings where the supernatural is rare, strange, or feared, Adepts are likely rare and feared as well. They remain hidden, shadowy figures. When this is not the case, Adepts are more likely to be common and forthright. They might even take leadership roles.    
    
>**Advanced Adepts:** Even at low tiers, Adept powers are impressive. Higher-tier Adepts can accomplish amazing deeds that can reshape matter and the environment around them.  
  
>[!info]  
>Adepts are almost always emblematic of the paranormal or superhuman in some way—wizards, psychics, or something similar. If the game you’re playing has none of that, an Adept could be a charlatan mimicking such abilities with tricks and hidden devices, or a gadgeteer character with a “utility belt” full of oddments. Or a game like that might not have Adepts. That’s okay too.    
  
#### ADEPT PLAYER INTRUSIONS    
When playing an Adept, you can spend 1 XP to use one of the following player intrusions, provided the situation is appropriate and the GM agrees.    
>**Advantageous Malfunction:** A device being used against you malfunctions. It might harm the user or one of their allies for a round, or activate a dramatic and distracting side effect for a few rounds.    
  
>**Convenient Idea:** A flash of insight provides you with a clear answer or suggests a course of action with regard to an urgent question, problem, or obstacle you’re facing.    
  
>**Inexplicably Unbroken:** An inactive, ruined, or presumed-destroyed device temporarily activates and performs a useful function relevant to the situation. This is enough to buy you some time for a better solution, alleviate a complication that was interfering with your abilities, or just get you one more use out of a depleted cypher or artifact.

| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1   | You served as an apprentice for an Adept respected and feared by many people. Now you bear their mark.                                                            |                |
| 2   | You studied in a school infamous for its dark, brooding instructors and graduates.                                                                                |                |
| 3   | You learned your abilities in the temple of an obscure god. Its priests and worshippers, although small in number, respect and admire your talents and potential. |                |
| 4   | While traveling alone, you saved the life of a powerful person. They remain indebted to you.                                                                      |                |
| 5   | Your mother was a powerful Adept while she lived, helpful to many locals. They look upon you kindly, but they also expect much from you.                          |                |
| 6   | You owe money to a number of people and don’t have the funds to pay your debts.                                                                                   |                |
| 7   | You failed disgracefully at your initial studies with your teacher and now proceed on your own.                                                                   |                |
| 8   | You learned your skills faster than your teachers had ever seen before. The powers that be took notice and are paying close attention.                            |                |
| 9   | You killed a well-known criminal in self-defense, earning the respect of many and the enmity of a dangerous few.                                                  |                |
| 10  | You trained as a Warrior, but your Adept predilections eventually led you down a different path. Your former comrades don’t understand you, but they respect you. |                |
| 11  | While studying to be an Adept, you worked as an assistant for a bank, making friends with the owner and the clientele.                                            |                |
| 12  | Your family owns a large vineyard nearby known to all for its fine wine and fair business dealings.                                                               |                |
| 13  | You trained for a time with a group of influential Adepts, and they still look upon you with fondness.                                                            |                |
| 14  | You worked the gardens in the palace of an influential noble or person of wealth. They wouldn’t remember you, but you made friends with their young daughter.     |                |
| 15  | An experiment you conducted in the past went horribly awry. The locals remember you as a dangerous and foolhardy individual.                                      |                |
| 16  | You hail from a distant place where you were well known and regarded, but people here treat you with suspicion.                                                   |                |
| 17  | People you meet seem put off by the strange birthmark on your face.                                                                                               |                |
| 18  | Your best friend is also an Adept. You and your friend share discoveries and secrets readily.                                                                     |                |
| 19  | You know a local merchant very well. Since you give them so much business, they offer you discounts and special treatment.                                        |                |
| 20  | You belong to a secretive social club that gathers monthly to drink and talk.                                                                                     |                |

#### ADEPT EXAMPLE    
>Jen wants to create an Adept—a sorcerer for a fantasy campaign. She decides to be somewhat well rounded, so she puts 2 of her additional points into each stat Pool, giving her a Might Pool of 9, a Speed Pool of 11, and an Intellect Pool of 14. Her Adept is smart and quick. She has an Intellect Edge of 1, a Might Edge of 0, and a Speed Edge of 0. As a first-tier character, her Effort is 1. As her initial abilities, she chooses Onslaught and Ward, giving her a strong offense and defense. She also chooses Magic Training and rounds out her character with Scan, which she hopes will be useful in gaining insight and information. For this character, Onslaught, Ward, and Scan are all spells she has mastered through years of training and study.    
She can bear three cyphers. The GM gives her a potion that acts as a short-range teleporter, a small charm that restores 5 points to her Intellect Pool, and a fluid-filled flask that explodes like a fiery bomb. Jen’s sorcerer is skilled with light weapons, so she chooses a dagger.     
For her descriptor, Jen chooses Graceful, which adds 2 points to her Speed Pool, bringing it to 13. That descriptor means she is trained in balancing and anything requiring careful movements, physical performing arts, and Speed defense tasks. Perhaps she is a dancer. In fact, she begins to develop a backstory that involves graceful, lithe movements that she incorporates into her spells.    
For her focus, she chooses Leads. This gives her training in social interactions, which again helps round her out—she’s good in all kinds of situations. Moreover, she has the Good Advice ability, which enables her to be a focal point of her group.    
Her spells and focus abilities cost Intellect points to activate, so she’s glad to have a lot of points in her Intellect Pool. In addition, her Intellect Edge will help reduce those costs. If she uses her Onslaught force blast without applying Effort, it costs 0 Intellect points and deals 4 points of damage. Her Intellect Edge will allow her to save points to devote toward applying Effort for other purposes, perhaps to boost the accuracy of Onslaught.  
For her character arc, Jen chooses Aid a Friend. She decides that when her sorcerer character was young, she had a magical mentor. That mentor was later taken prisoner by a demon, so her character is always looking for clues on how to find the demon and release her friend from bondage.    
  
  
>[!info]  
>GMs are always free to pre-select a type’s special abilities at a given tier to reinforce the setting. In the fantasy setting of Jen’s sorcerer, the GM might have said that all sorcerers (Adepts) start with Magic Training as one of their tier 1 abilities. This doesn’t make the character any less powerful or special, but it says something about her role in the world and expectations in the game.
