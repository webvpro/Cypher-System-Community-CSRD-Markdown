Suffuses the user's body with a mixture of colloidal silver (sil), concentrated garlic (gar), and holy water (ho), making the user repellent to most vampires, which usually have an aversion to one or more of these materials. Vampire attacks with melee weapons against the user are hindered. Any PC vampire who attempts to feed on the user gains no sustenance and must make a Might defense roll or feel nauseous and have all their actions hindered for one minute. Any NPC vampire who attempts to feed on the user gains no sustenance and all their actions are hindered for one minute. The cypher's effect persists in the user's body for one day (two days if the cypher is level 4 or higher). If used directly against a vampire instead of being applied to a living creature, it affects the vampire as silver, garlic, and holy water normally would. Because a human body can't dispose of colloidal silver, excessive intake of it causes a condition called argyria that turns skin purple or purple-grey.
