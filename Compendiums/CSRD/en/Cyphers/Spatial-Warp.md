## Spatial Warp  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+4  
> **Kind:** Fantastic
  
When affixed to a device that affects a single target at range, that range is increased to 1 mile (1.5 km) with no penalties. Space is temporarily warped in terms of seeing and reaching the target. If direct line of sight is important to the device's effect, it remains important. The spatial warp lasts 10 minutes per cypher level.
