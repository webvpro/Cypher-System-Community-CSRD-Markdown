The nut opens to reveal a stunning and spectacular ballgown, evening dress, or tuxedo. The outfit is the perfect size, shape, style, and color for the person who wishes to wear it. While worn, the outfit eases all tasks involving charm, persuasion, and etiquette for one hour. After that, the outfit may still be worn, but no longer offers any benefits. Beings of all genders can wear any form of outfit from the dressmaking nut and receive the benefits.
