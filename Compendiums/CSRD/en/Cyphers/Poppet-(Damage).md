## Poppet (Damage)

>Small Figure Made of Cloth, Stuffed with Hair and Bone
  
Writing the name of an object or living being on the figure connects the figure with that object or being. Destroying the poppet inflicts damage on the connected object or being equal to the cypher's level, no matter how far away it is. Writing the name and destroying the poppet are separate actions.
