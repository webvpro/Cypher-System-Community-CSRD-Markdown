## Tracer  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6  
> **Kind:** Manifest
  
Fires a microscopic tracer that clings to any surface within short range. For the next twenty-four hours, the launcher shows the distance and direction to the tracer, as long as it is within 1 mile (100 miles if the cypher is level 3 or higher, in the same dimension if the cypher is level 6 or higher).
