## Machine Control    
>[!info] Stats    
> **Level:** 1d6+2    
> **Kind:** Fantastic  
    
Splits into two pieces; one is affixed to a device and the other to a character. The character can then use their mind to control the device at long range, bidding it to do anything it could do normally. Thus, a device could be activated or deactivated, and a vehicle could be piloted. The control lasts for ten minutes per cypher level, and once the device is chosen, it cannot be changed.
