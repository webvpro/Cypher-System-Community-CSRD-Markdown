## Homunculus Flask  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+1  
> **Form:** Ornate, Opaque Alchemical Bottle Filled with Strange Fluid
  
To activate this cypher, you must open the bottle, add a few fresh drops of your blood (inflicting 1 point of Might damage to you), stopper it again, and leave it alone for one day. When the bottle is next unstoppered, a hand-sized creature called a homunculus crawls out; it vaguely resembles you and serves you for one day per cypher level before dissolving into useless goo. Each time you give it an order, you must make an Intellect defense roll against it; if you fail, it becomes free to ignore your commands (but might pretend to be obedient so it can plot against you). Homunculus: level 2; alchemy, all defenses, and stealth as level 3.
