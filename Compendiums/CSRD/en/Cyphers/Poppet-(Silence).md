## Poppet (Silence)  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+2  
> **Form:** Small Figure Carved From Wood or Stone, with an Open Mouth  
> **Kind:** Fairy Tale
  
Stuffing the open mouth with something that belongs to a living being (such as hair, teeth, or fabric) connects the figure to that being. For the following day, the being is unable to talk about, point to, see, or otherwise engage with the person who activated the poppet.
