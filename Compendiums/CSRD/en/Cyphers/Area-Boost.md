## Area Boost  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+1  
> **Kind:** Power Boost
  
This cypher boosts an ability that affects a single target. The ability expands the effect so it includes the immediate area around that target. If the ability normally affects an immediate area, the area becomes short. Short areas are increased to long. Long areas are increased to very long. Abilities with very long areas become 1,000-foot (300 m) areas. All other areas double in radius.
