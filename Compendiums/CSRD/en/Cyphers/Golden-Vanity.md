>Golden Vanity Set in a Small, Sturdy Box that Includes a Brush, Comb, and Mirror
  
Each item may be used once and has a different effect: Golden brush: Creates bristly terrain in an immediate area, which counts as difficult terrain. Golden comb: Creates jagged, toothy rocks in an immediate area, making it extremely painful to cross. Characters within the area take 1 point of damage each round from the rocks. Golden mirror: Turns into a tall glass mountain 30 feet tall by 300 feet wide (9 m by 90 m). All climbing tasks are hindered, and a fall from any height does 3 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor). The landscape effects are permanent. The golden vanity counts as a single cypher against the character's cypher limit. When all three items have been used, it remains a functional vanity set but no longer holds any magic.
