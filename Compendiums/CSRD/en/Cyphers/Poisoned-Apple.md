## Poisoned Apple  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+2  
> **Form:** Apple that Is Half White and Half Red  
> **Kind:** Fairy Tale
  
Eating from the white half heals the user, restoring a number of points equal to the cypher's level to their Might Pool. Eating from the red half poisons the user, inflicting damage equal to the cypher's level. Each half of the apple has the power to affect only one creature. Both halves of the apple can be used by the same or different people as long as it's done within a few rounds of each other. However, in order for the cypher to take effect, the user must willingly take a bite. It's impossible, for instance, to force-feed someone part of the apple and have the cypher activate.
