## Hunter/Seeker  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6  
> **Kind:** Manifest
  
With long-range movement, this intelligent missile tracks and attacks a specified target (target must be within sight when selected). If it misses, it continues to attack one additional time per cypher level until it hits. For example, a level 4 hunter/seeker will attack a maximum of five times. Roll a d100 to determine the type of attack.  

|  Roll &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Hunter/Seeker  |  
| ------------- | :----------- |  
| 1-50 | Inflicts 8 points of damage. |  
| 51-80 | Bears a poisoned needle that inflicts 3 points of damage plus poison. |  
| 81-90 | Explodes, inflicting 6 points of damage to all within immediate range. |  
| 91-95 | Shocks for 4 points of electricity damage, and stuns for one round per cypher level. |  
| 96-100 | Covers target in sticky goo that immediately hardens, holding them fast until they break free with a Might action (difficulty equal to the cypher's level + 2). |
