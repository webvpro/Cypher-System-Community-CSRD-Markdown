## Horrific Integrated Weapon  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+3  
> **Form:** Weapon You Can Hold in One Hand
  
The weapon extends tendrils, skin, wires, nerves, or other material into and through the user's hand, physically connecting itself to the user for one hour per cypher level. While connected, the user gains an asset on attacks with the weapon and cannot be disarmed, but cannot use that hand for anything except wielding the weapon. The user can detach or reattach the weapon by spending a full minute concentrating on its physical connection to their body. When the duration ends, the weapon detaches and becomes a normal weapon of its type. Roll a d20 to determine the kind of weapon:
