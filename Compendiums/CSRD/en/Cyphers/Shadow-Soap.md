When rubbed on your visible shadow, causes it to separate from yourself.The shadow acts as a level 4 creature under the user's control for one hour (or until there is no light). The shadow is two-dimensional and insubstantial, and when sneaking, hiding, and avoiding detection, it acts as a level 7 creature. When the effect ends, the shadow (usually) returns to the user. Shadows are known to develop a mind of their own. Sometimes after tasting a bit of freedom, they refuse to return.
