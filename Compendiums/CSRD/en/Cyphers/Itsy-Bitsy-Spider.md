## Itsy Bitsy Spider  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6  
> **Form:** Tiny Spider Inside a Jar, Box, or Thimble  
> **Kind:** Fairy Tale
  
When released, the spider sets up a web in a nearby corner. For the next ten minutes, the web catches thoughts, secrets, and information about the general area (up to about a square mile), including any creatures, people, weather, or goings on. At the end of that time, the user can read the web, gaining answers to a number of questions equal to the cypher's level. The questions must pertain to the area and must be simple enough that the spider can answer them in three words or less.
