## Armor Breach  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6
  
A successfully targeted creature or object within short range becomes coated with a clinging film of nanotech for one minute. While coated, a creature has 2 less Armor than usual (3 less if the cypher is level 5 or 6). While coated, an object temporarily moves one step down the object damage track (or two steps down if the cypher is level 5 or 6).
