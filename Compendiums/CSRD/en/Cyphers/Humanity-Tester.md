Reveals whether a targeted creature is human or some sort of inhuman impostor (such as an alien, demon, doppelganger, simulacrum, or vampire) if the cypher's level is greater than the creature's disguise level. If the cypher's level exceeds the impostor's level by 4 or more, it also marks the impostor for the next several hours so people can recognize it by this mark. The specific nature of a humanity tester depends on the setting and what sort of creatures are common. In a world with multiple kinds of creatures that pretend to be human, the tester might recognize all fakes or detect only one specific kind of fake.
