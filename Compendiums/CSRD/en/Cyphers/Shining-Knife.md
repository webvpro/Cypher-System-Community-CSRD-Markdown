## Shining Knife    
>[!info] Stats    
> **Level:** 1d6+3    
> **Form:** Shining Knife  
    
When stuck into an object, such as a tree or the side of a house, the knife connects the wielder and someone they choose. If one of them wants to know how the other is faring, all they have to do is return to the spot where the knife is stuck. If both are faring well, the knife shines bright gold. If harm has come to one, the knife is dull and rusted.
