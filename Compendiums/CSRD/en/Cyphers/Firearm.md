## Firearm  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+1  
> **Kind:** Scavenger Subtle
  
One of the following items is gained; roll randomly. If the cypher's level is 6 or higher, the character can choose which item they obtain. A firearm is usually found with about ten bullets or shells (or crossbow bolts). The discovered firearm works, but it is damaged and has a GM intrusion range of 1-3 on a d20. In addition to any other effect of a GM intrusion, the firearm breaks (but could be repaired).
