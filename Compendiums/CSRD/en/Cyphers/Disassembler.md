Recycles waste or other unwanted material by breaking it down to constituent atoms and molecules. If used destructively, this cypher can disassemble an object within immediate range whose level is equal to or less than the cypher's level that fits into a 10-foot (3.5 m) cube, or it can create a cavity of the same volume in a larger object whose level is less than the cypher's level. If used as a weapon against creatures, the cypher can be hurled a short distance like a detonation, inflicting damage equal to the cypher's level in an immediate area and reducing the effectiveness of any Armor worn by targets by 1.
