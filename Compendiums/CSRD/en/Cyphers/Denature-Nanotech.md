## Denature Nanotech  
>Level: 1d6+3  
  
Coats a short area surrounding the user, or adjacent to the user, with a nearly invisible film of nanotech that lasts for years. The first time anyone attempts to use a nanotech-based cypher, ability, or other effect in the affected area whose level is less than this cypher's level, that use is suppressed and fails. Once one effect is suppressed, the denaturing effect is expended. The cypher instead can be used to end one ongoing nanotech effect of the cypher's level or less in a short area, but the user must succeed on an Intellect attack roll against the level of the effect or the target creating the effect. For instance, if this cypher is successfully used against a creature genetically engineered by nanotech, the creature would become so much inert biological matter.
