## Fabricator, Civil  
>Level: 1d6+1  
  
Assembles a specified object whose level is equal to the cypher's level. Once created, the object is permanent until destroyed. A civil fabricator can build one object on the Additional Post-Apocalyptic Equipment table (or another equipment table in the Cypher System Rulebook) that falls into the "other items" category--no weapons or armor. The user chooses which item to fabricate by speaking aloud the name of the item they want as they activate the cypher. The higher the cypher level, the more expensive an item the fabricator can create, as follows: Level 2 cyphers can fabricate inexpensive items, cyphers of level 3 or less can fab inexpensive and moderately priced items, cyphers of level 6 or less can fab up to expensive items, and level 7 cyphers can fab up to very expensive items. A civil fabricator can create appropriately priced food items. However, it can't fabricate living creatures.
