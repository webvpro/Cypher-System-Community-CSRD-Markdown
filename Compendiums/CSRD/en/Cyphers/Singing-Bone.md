## Singing Bone  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+3  
> **Form:** Human Bone Carved Into the Mouthpiece for a Musical Instrument  
> **Kind:** Fairy Tale
  
When blown into, the bone sings a song that details the weaknesses and faults of one target (up to the level of the cypher) that the user chooses. For ten minutes, all tasks involving the target are eased for everyone in long range who heard the bone's song. For most magical objects involving sound, it's not necessary to physically hear the item in order to gain the benefits. "Hearing" may involve sensing vibrations, magical mental telepathy, a sign language interpreter, and so on.
