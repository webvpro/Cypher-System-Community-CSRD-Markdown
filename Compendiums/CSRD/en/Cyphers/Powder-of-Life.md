## Powder of Life  
>Level: 1d6+3  
  
>[!info] Form  
>Bit of Powder Carried in a Pepper Box
  
When sprinkled on an inanimate object, the powder brings it to life. The object doesn't change in any way--a small cat made of glass remains a small cat made of glass--except that now it is alive. The living object acts as a level 2 creature with a mind of its own. While it has an affinity or obligation for the one who brought it to life, it doesn't obey commands. Objects animated by the powder of life should have stats that represent their form and nature. For example, a tin soldier brought to life likely has 1 Armor and perhaps a light weapon, while a stuffed rabbit might be level 3 for the purpose of Speed defense, hiding, and sneaking.
