## Detonation Prion  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+2
  
Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away that bursts in an immediate radius, inflicting damage equal to the cypher's level. On a hit, the living tissue of targets whose level is less than the cypher's level begins to unravel due to a prion-unfolding chain reaction. These targets take damage equal to the cypher's level on the first round, then 1 point of damage each subsequent round until only so much cloudy pink fluid remains. PCs can make a Might defense roll each round to end the effect; two successful defense rolls end the chain reaction. NPCs whose level is equal to or higher than the cypher's level take damage from the cypher for only one round.
