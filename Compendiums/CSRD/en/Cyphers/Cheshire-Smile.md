## Cheshire Smile  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6  
> **Form:** Mischievous Grin  
> **Kind:** Fairy Tale
  
When hung in the air, the grin slowly transforms into a grey Cheshire Cat that seems to be made mostly of smoke and shadow. It has huge blue eyes and an enormous grin. The cat acts as a creature (level equal to the cypher's level) with a mind of its own, although it likely helps the person who activated the cypher. It sticks around for ten minutes, and then fades away slowly, until even the original smile has disappeared.
