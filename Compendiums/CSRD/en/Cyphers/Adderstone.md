For the next day, provides the character with one of the following benefits. Roll a d20 or choose from the table.Adderstones are sometimes also called hagstones, seer stones, and holey stones. Beware false adderstones, which are made by enterprising swindlers who drill or carve a hole out of a regular stone and attempt to pass it off as something more. If a character has no hair in which to tie an adderstone, perhaps they can "borrow" some from a friend, a domesticated animal, or a foe.

| 1-3 | When looking through the hole, the user gains an asset to seeing things that are normally invisible to the eye, including doorways, beings, spirits, magical effects, and so on. |  
| 4-6 | When worn on the finger as a ring, wards off spirits of the dead (grants +1 Armor against attacks from ghosts, haunts, and other spirits of the dead). |  
| 7-9 | When attached to physical armor, adds 1 to the Armor it provides (adds 2 to the Armor if the cypher is level 6 or higher). |  
| 10-12 | When held in the mouth, protects against poisons (up to the level of the cypher). |  
| 13-15 | When placed on the finger of another with good intent, it adds 1 to the recovery rolls of both the user and the wearer. |  
| 16-18 | When worn on a string around the neck, provides training in two noncombat skills of the user's choice that they are not already trained in. |  
| 19-20 | When tied in the hair, eases all defense tasks against curses by two steps. |
