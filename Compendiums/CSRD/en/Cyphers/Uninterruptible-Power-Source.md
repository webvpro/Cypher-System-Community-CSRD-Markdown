## Uninterruptible Power Source  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+4  
> **Kind:** Manifest
  
Provides power to another device for up to a day. The device to be powered can be as simple as a light source or as complex as a small starcraft, assuming the cypher's level is equal to the item's power requirements. A desk lamp is a level 1 power requirement, a car engine is a level 5 power requirement, and a starship is a level 10 power requirement.
