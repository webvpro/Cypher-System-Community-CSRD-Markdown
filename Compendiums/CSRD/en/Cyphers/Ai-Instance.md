## Ai Instance    
>[!info] Stats    
> **Level:** 1d6+1  
    
Installs an AI instance in an inert object. The instance persists for about a day. The AI's level is equal to this cypher's level. The AI has the ability to understand and audibly synthesize nearly any language and can provide answers to questions. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the higher its level. The instance can only answer questions equal to its level or less. Generally, knowledge that could be found by looking somewhere other than the current location is level 1 or higher, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the future is impossible. If the AI answers a question of level 5 or higher, the instance's existence terminates. Alternatively, the AI can be used to engage another AI in the area, distracting it from taking direct actions for a number of minutes equal to this cypher's level. After this interval, the instance's existence terminates.
