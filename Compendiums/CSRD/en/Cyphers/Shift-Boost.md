## Shift Boost    
>[!info] Stats    
> **Level:** 1d6+2    
> **Kind:** Power Boost  
    
This cypher boosts one power shift that the user already has, granting them an additional power shift in that category that lasts for one round. For example, if the user has a shift in resilience, they can use this cypher to gain an additional shift in resilience for one round. If the user has more than one kind of power shift (such as dexterity and strength), they choose which kind of power shift to boost.
