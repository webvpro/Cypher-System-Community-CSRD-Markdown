| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-20                      | Sleep. The creature falls into a deep, dreamless sleep. While sleeping, the creature cannot take any actions, but is protected by a glass coffin that grants +2 Armor. The creature wakes if they are touched by someone they love or if they take damage. |
| 21-40                     | Disappear. The creature becomes invisible to everyone and everything for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level. During that time, they cannot be heard, felt, or sensed.                                                                            |
| 41-60                     | Alter. The creature becomes physically altered until they are unrecognizable, even                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 61-75                     | Lost. The creature becomes deeply and frighteningly lost, even if they are in familiar surroundings (such as their own bedroom). They do not recognize any landmarks, cannot find their way, and feel a deep sense of panic.                               |
| 76-85                     | Breathless. The creature feels like they are unable to breathe, gulping air and short of breath. Although they are not dying, they feel as though they are. All tasks are hindered.                                                                        |
| 86-95                     | Compulsion. The creature becomes obsessed with a single task, unable to do anything else until they achieve it. The task might be simple (picking the most beautiful rose from                                                                             |
| 96-100                    | Dutiful. The creature becomes much easier to interact with. All tasks to influence the poisoned creature are eased by two steps.                                                                                                                           |
