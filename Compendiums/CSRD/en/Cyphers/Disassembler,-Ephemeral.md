## Disassembler, Ephemeral    
>[!info] Stats    
> **Level:** 1d6+2  
    
An object or creature whose level is equal to or less than this cypher's level within immediate range is temporarily disassembled into its component atoms and molecules. The disassembly lasts for up to ten hours or until a time specified by the user, whichever occurs first. When the effect ends, the object or creature is reassembled over the course of one round at the location where it was disassembled (or at the location the fine "dust" of its disassembly was moved to). A Speed attack roll is necessary to affect an unwilling target. PCs can make a Might defense roll to resist being disassembled.
