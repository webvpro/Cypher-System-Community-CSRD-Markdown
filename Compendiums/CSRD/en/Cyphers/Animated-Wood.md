## Animated Wood  
>Level: 1d6  
  
>[!info] Form  
>Chunk of Pine, Alder, or Other Wood Imbued with Magical Properties
  
Writing a word, such as "child," "horse," or "sword," on the wood causes it to become a living version of that word. The living version is no bigger than 10 feet by 10 feet by 20 feet (3 m by 3 m by 6 m) and its level is equal to the cypher level. It can make attacks or perform actions as commanded to the best of its abilities and lasts for one hour per cypher level. Commanding it is not an action. Once activated, animated wood is not an unthinking, docile being. It may, in fact, resist the user's commands and attempt to take its own actions. Any actions it takes cannot be harmful to the user or the user's allies. The user may attempt to stop an unwanted action via persuasion, intimidation, and so on (any such tasks against the animated wood are eased by two steps).
