Rubbing the cloth over a wound heals the wound (restores all points to the character's Pools), but also uses up one recovery roll for the day. Genie's handkerchiefs come in many colors and materials. Some people find that after their magic is used up, they make fine blankets, curtains, or cloaks. Of course, extended exposure to mercury has its drawbacks.
