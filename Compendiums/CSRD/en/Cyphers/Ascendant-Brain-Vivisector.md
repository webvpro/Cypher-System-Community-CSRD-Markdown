## Ascendant Brain Vivisector  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+4  
> **Form:** Device, Injection, or Pill
  
If used on a beast whose level is less than the cypher level, this enhances connections in the beast's brain so it attains near-human intelligence and sapience, and gains a basic understanding of one specific language keyed to the cypher. The beast remembers its prior, simpler existence and understands that it has been made smarter. This transformation lasts for one day per cypher level, and then the beast reverts to its normal self slowly over the same number of days, often with violent and erratic outbreaks. For example, if the beast becomes smarter for five days, it loses intelligence gradually over days 6 through 9 and is back to normal on day 10. Additional uses of the cypher tend to have diminishing returns. When used with an ascendant flesh vivisector, the resulting creature looks, thinks, and acts like a human. Using this cypher on a beast whose level is too high might end up elevating its intelligence somewhat but also instigating aggressive behavior.
