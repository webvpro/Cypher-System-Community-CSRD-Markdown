When a character places their soul inside the needle and places the needle inside the egg, they are protected from their next death. When the character dies, they return to life on the next round, with all of their Pools full. Using the deathless does not protect the character from taking damage or moving down the damage track. Placing the soul and returning to life are actions. Once the cypher holds the user's soul, it no longer counts against their cypher limit. If someone gets a hold of another person's soul, they have a great deal of power over that person (such as easing all actions against them by three steps). Those who use a deathless should ensure that it's well hidden and well protected.
