When the user spends ten minutes breathing into the mouth of the bird, it comes to life. It flies off, but now carries a piece of the user's life inside it. When the user dies, the bird flies back to their body and is able to communicate to those around it, but only for one day. After that, the bird returns to its lifeless form.
