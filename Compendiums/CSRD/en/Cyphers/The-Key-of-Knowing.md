When used to open a lock (of the cypher level or lower), grants the user the opportunity to ask three yes-or-no questions about a person, place, or thing. The key answers to the best of its ability and knowledge, and it does not attempt to lie or trick the user with its answer. After the key is used in this way, the blood disappears from its surface and the key refuses to open anything (or speak) ever again.
