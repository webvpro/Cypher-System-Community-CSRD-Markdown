## Force Cube    
>[!info] Stats    
> **Level:** 1d6+3    
> **Kind:** Fantastic  
    
Creates an immobile cube composed of six planes of solid force, each 30 feet (9 m) to a side, for one hour. The planes conform to the space available. (Although a force cube's walls are not gaseous permeable, there is likely enough air within for trapped creatures to breathe for the hour it lasts.)
