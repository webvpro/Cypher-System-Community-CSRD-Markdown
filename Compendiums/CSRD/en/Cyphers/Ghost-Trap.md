## Ghost Trap  
>[!info] Stats  
> **Level:** 1d6+2  
> **Form:** Crystal or Device
  
Can be thrown up to a short distance, where it releases a burst of transdimensional energy in an immediate area that absorbs ghosts (including spirits, phased beings, and similar creatures) but does not affect corporeal entities. PCs who meet these criteria must use an Intellect-based action (difficulty equal to the cypher level) to avoid being trapped. NPC ghosts are not affected if their level is higher than the cypher level. The trap holds the ghosts for up to one hour per cypher level, after which they automatically break free (and are probably very angry). Ghosts in a trap can be permanently stored in a ghost vault.
