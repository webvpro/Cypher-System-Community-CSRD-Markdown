## Screen Control   
>[!info] Stats    
> **Level:** 1d6+2   
> **Kind:** Magical Technology  
    
A technological screen (a television, computer monitor, smartphone, or the like) within short range shows whatever the user wishes for up to one minute per cypher level. The display can be pictures, text, or meaningless shapes and colors.  
Because magic works on intuitive rather than scientific levels, mages could have spells that disrupt technology, even though the technology involved might not have any common principles
