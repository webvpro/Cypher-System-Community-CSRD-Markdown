Summons a group of helpful fey who provide assistance for ten minutes. During this time, they do as the wearer commands as long as they're within long range. They can hinder any or all opponents' tasks, provide information, assist in small tasks, and so on. The fey will not do anything that goes against their basic nature and safety (such as self-harm, attacking their friends, or obvious suicide missions). Fey are fickle beings. While spirit rings and the like allow someone to hold power over them, it's very much dependent on the fey's blessing. Angering the fey may cause them to leave at any moment (even in the middle of something important), and they may take the time to curse or prank the characters before they disappear.
