## Merges Mind with Machine  
You were raised in an underground bunker by Milly, an AI instance installed in your brain before you developed cognition of your own. Unlike AI zombies, your personality and motivations haven't been replaced; your sense of self grew alongside the AI, as collaborators rather than foes. This granted you superior intellect and an uncanny knack for computers. Now you've emerged into the larger world, where survivors are predisposed to distrust you, and you may need to keep your background a secret to be accepted. Whether you hate AI or remain loyal to Milly, you face the best odds if you can fit in with another group of survivors. After all, there's a lot you don't know about how things work on the surface and the things people have done to stay alive in the past twenty years.  

>[!info]- Connections  
>Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.  
>- Pick one other PC. You fear that character is jealous of your abilities, and that it might lead to problems.  
>- Pick one other PC. You're not sure how or from where, but that character has access to rare machine parts and can get them for you at half price.  
>- Pick one other PC. Seeing you use your focus abilities triggers unpleasant memories for that character. That memory is up to the other PC, although they may not be able to consciously recall it.  
>- Pick one other PC. They are sensitive to your focus abilities, and occasionally they become dazed for a few rounds, hindering their actions.  

>[!info] Effects  
>**Minor,** You restore 2 points to your Intellect Pool.  
>**Major,** An ally or indicated target can take an additional action.  

>[!info] Additional Equipment  
>You have scars on your scalp in the shape of circuitry (like Lichtenberg figures). You probably keep these hidden, as they identify you as one of Milly's children to anyone familiar with the mark.
