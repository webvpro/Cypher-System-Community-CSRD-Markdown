## Inks Spells on Skin    
Your enchanted heritage is etched upon you. Studying strange formulas, mystic runes, and magical glyphs to learn spells is one thing. Making spells truly a part of you is another, but that’s exactly what you do when you apply magical inks to create intricate spell tattoos across your body. Each tattoo you inscribe on yourself is not merely a design, but the keystone of a spell, giving you the ability to cast it. Because your tattoos are magical, you can continually add to those you’ve already accumulated without ruining the designs, allowing your mastery over magic to grow. You often wear clothing that bares your arms and perhaps other parts of your body to expose your tattoos, so that others know you for a spellcaster.  
  
Readying Spell Tattoos: You learn two abilities (spells) at every tier of this focus, and each of them becomes a tattoo on your body. However, for each tier’s spells, you can only have one of the two readied (available for casting) at any given time, and the other is merely an interesting design until you change your readied spell for that tier. To change one readied spell, immediately after using a one-hour or ten-hour recovery roll, you must spend one minute in meditation, after which you can swap one readied spell.  
  
The Inks Spells on Skin focus works similarly to the [Masters Spells](Masters-Spells.md) focus. The GM may consider allowing characters with either of these foci to choose abilities from either focus when they advance to a new tier.  
  
  
### Connection:   
>1. Pick one other PC. They once broke a bottle of one of your magical tattoo inks. It’s up to you if you’ve forgiven them or not.  
>2. Pick one other PC. You think they could learn your tattoo magic, and you’d like to teach them. They may or may not be interested in learning it.  
>3. Pick one other PC. Whenever you ready your spells for the day, this character feels faint pain on their body where your corresponding tattoo is.  
>4. Pick one other PC. This character asked you to give them a tattoo, so you did. Somehow, now you can always sense their general direction and distance from you.  
### Additional Equipment  
>Special ink, a tattooing needle, and a clay, stone, or wooden tablet marked with strange glyphs.  
### Minor Effect Suggestion   
Exposed skin on the target creature is marked with a glowing glyph of your choice for one hour.  
### Major Effect Suggestion  
>The foe is cursed, hindering all their actions for one minute.
