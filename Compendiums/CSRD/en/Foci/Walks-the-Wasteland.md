## Walks the Wasteland  
Most people want to hide from the devastation or just curl up and die rather than face a hostile world. Not you. You're determined to see what's out there, to survive, and, more than that, to thrive. It's that or let the radioactive rats--or whatever it is that hunts the ruins--get you. If you were around before the end, you could have been a soldier, mercenary, or at least someone who had basic survival training. What sets you apart from all the others like you is that you decided to hope when everything looked darkest. Since then, you have eaten your share of spoiled food and irradiated water, and survived. Whether that's because you've adapted, you're luckier, or you were just tougher than the rest is anyone's guess. But you're still walking the wastes even though so many others are gone. You probably don't spend a lot of time on your appearance, given that you wear the cobbled-together clothing and bits and pieces of armor you're able to scavenge from the ruins. Appearance doesn't matter; actions do.  

>[!info]- Connections  
>Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.  
>- Pick one other PC. This character appears to be an able survivor, but in your mind, they seem to be at the end of their rope. You're constantly trying to convince them to keep trying, go the distance, and survive for a better tomorrow.  
>- Pick one other PC. You feel very protective of this character and don't want to see them harmed.  
>- Pick one other PC. This character comes from the same place you do, and you knew each other as children. Whether that place exists any longer is something you and that character should decide.  
>- Pick one other PC. You found this character almost dead in the wastes. You rescued them, nursed them back to health, and kept them safe until they were back on their feet. Whether they feel embarrassment, gratitude, or something else is up to them.  

>[!info] Effects  
>**Minor,** You restore 2 points to your Might Pool.  
>**Major,** Your next action is eased by two steps.  

>[!info] Additional Equipment  
>You have a piece of before-times equipment with three analog dials that measure temperature, air pressure, and humidity. (You also know the names for the instruments nestled behind those dials: a thermometer, a barometer, and a hygrometer, respectively.) If you spend a minute operating the device, you have an asset on weather prediction tasks extending into the next day.
