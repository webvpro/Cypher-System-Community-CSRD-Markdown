## Travels Through Time  
You can see through time, try to reach through it, and eventually even travel through it.  

>[!note] Note  
>Although all character choices are subject to GM approval, Travels Through Time is a focus that the GM and player should probably have a long conversation about ahead of time, so the player knows the rules of time travel (if any) that exist in the GM's setting. A character with this focus can drastically alter a setting, if the rules of time travel allow it.
