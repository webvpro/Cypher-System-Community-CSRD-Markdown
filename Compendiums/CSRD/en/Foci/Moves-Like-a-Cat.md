## Moves Like a Cat  
Lithe, flexible, and graceful, you move quickly and smoothly, and never seem to be where danger is.  

>[!info] Intrusions  
>- Even a cat can be clumsy.  
>- A jump isn't quite as easy as it looks.  
>- An escape move is so overzealous that it sends the character right into harm's way.
