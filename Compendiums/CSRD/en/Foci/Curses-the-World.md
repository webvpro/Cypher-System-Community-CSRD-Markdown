## Curses the World
Fuck the world and its horrors. You have a mean streak living inside you that you can’t control—and honestly have no desire to. You’d never hurt your friends and family, of course. But everyone and everything else? Curse them.

>[!note] Focus Note
>Characters who Curse the World aren’t necessarily evil or wicked; they are angry, hurt, and possibly seeking to get even with those who have wronged them or the ones they love (or at least keep themselves and their loved ones from being hurt again).
