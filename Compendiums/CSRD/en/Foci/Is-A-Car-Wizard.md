## Is A Car Wizard  
Your skill behind the wheel is legendary, combining natural talent and specialized magic to perform stunts and tricks that are impossible for regular people. Nothing beats the feel of wind in your hair, except maybe the intense purr of a finely tuned engine augmented by sorcery. You love pushing yourself (and your vehicle) to the limit, even if it’s dangerous—better to die a legend than live a long, dull life driving something boring. You enjoy drawing attention to yourself, so you tend to wear sleek clothing, stylish sunglasses, and borderline-gaudy jewelry, but never anything that interferes with your ability to control a car or cast a spell.  
  
  
### Connection:   
>1. Pick one other PC. To repay a favor they did for you a while ago, you promised to drive them somewhere. They haven’t taken you up on it yet.  
>2. Pick one other PC. You were the getaway driver for them once in the past— perhaps for something criminal, a car stunt for a viral video, or to avoid a bad situation.  
>3. Pick one other PC. You know they were once in a very bad car collision that left the vehicle a wreck, but they somehow weren’t hurt at all.  
>4. Pick one other PC. They used to associate with someone who was trying to hunt you down, but they haven’t been in contact with that person in a while.  
  
### Additional Equipment   
>A reasonably fast car.  
### Minor Effect Suggestion   
>The foe you hit (with your spell or car) is moved horizontally an immediate distance in a direction ### of your choice.  
### Major Effect Suggestion   
>The foe is knocked prone and loses their next action.
