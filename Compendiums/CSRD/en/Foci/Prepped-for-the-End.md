## Prepped for the End  
You prepared for ultimate disaster, unlike most of the sheeple. Which means you stashed away food, water, and other survival gear when things were still okay. You trained yourself for harsh conditions, for basic machine and electronic repair, and maybe even in a musical instrument to pass the time in the bunker when no other entertainments could be had. You'd excel in a small group of other survivors, but you're ready to go it alone if that's what it takes. Above all, you're prepared to make it through whatever the future holds, no matter how daunting the odds. Because you prepped wisely.  

>[!info]- Connections  
>Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.  
>- Pick one other PC. You found them in your prepped hideout, eating and drinking their fill. You befriended them rather than seeking revenge for using your resources.  
>- Pick one other PC. You used to play card games with them before the apocalypse, and you still owe them money, though what that means now is difficult to say.  
>- Pick one other PC. This character doesn't seem to want any of your stored food or water.  
>- Pick one other PC. When you were hurt, they carried you to your prepped hideout at great risk to themselves.
