## Lived Among the Fey  
You spent a lot of time in another world, one that others don’t believe actually exists. What you learned there gives you insight and vision that most people don’t have. You’ve seen things. Beautiful things. Unspeakable things. Some of them came back with you and stay with you to this day.  
  
>[!note] Focus Note  
>A character who Lived Among the Fey might have spent time among the fairies (or other creatures in a different far-off land) or they may have dreamed, hallucinated, or imagined the whole thing. Do they know the difference? Does it matter? The name of the focus can be changed to something that more appropriately reflects the character’s experience, such as Fell Into Wonderland or Crossed Into Narnia.
