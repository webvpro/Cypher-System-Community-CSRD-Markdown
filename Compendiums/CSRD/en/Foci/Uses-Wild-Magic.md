## Uses Wild Magic  
spellcaster who learns a variety of spells instead of focusing on just one kind of magic.  
 ### Intrusion  
A spell performs erratically or rebounds upon the caster. Something interferes with preparing spells. Spellcasting attracts the attention of a powerful creature or potential rival. The cypher spell being cast is replaced with that of a random cypher.
