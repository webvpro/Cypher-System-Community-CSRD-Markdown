## Feigns No Fear
Everyone thinks you’re brave, intrepid— fearless, even. They tell stories about you, the person who’s never felt fear, how you went out to seek what you see as an elusive emotion and never found it. But you know the truth. You may present yourself as someone who is fearless and courageous, but deep down, you are terrified of everything. Fear drives you, and in its face, you stand tall and shout the loudest. Because you are also afraid of being seen for who you truly are.


>[!note] Focus Note
>A character who Feigns No Fear can be played in a number of ways, from someone who boasts constantly in their attempts to bolster themselves in front of others to someone who faces their fears through action, showing up first on the battle line to holler “Seven in one blow!”
