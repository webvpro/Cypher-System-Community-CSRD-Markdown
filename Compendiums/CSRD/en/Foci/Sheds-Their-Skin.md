## Sheds Their Skin
You have a secret self. In the quiet and stillness, you become not someone else, but something else. A being of tooth and nail, of flipper and fin, of mane and moon. But you believe that in order to survive and thrive, you must keep your other form secret, safe from prying eyes and listening ears.

>[!note] Focus Note
>Your beast form can be anything you choose, such as a selkie, wolf, horse, swan, and so on. Work with your GM to determine the details of your form. A character who Sheds Their Skin may also want to work with the GM to come up with even more suitable abilities for their particular form. For example, a selkie character might choose Aquatic Combatant as their tier 3 ability instead of one of the abilities listed here, particularly if the GM expects the character to be moving through water regularly.
