## Conjures Bullets
You blend sorcery and firearms into an amazing mix of magic and technology. Bullets and spells are almost interchangeable to you; your magic has a firearm motif and you cast using your gun. You might be a trick-shot sorcerer, a magical member of the armed forces, or an outlaw with a flair for arcane power. Gun nuts and wizard purists might look down on your blended technique, but you can do things that nobody else can do. You might call yourself a guncaster, spellshooter, or triggermage. You wear clothing that leaves your arms and hands free to use your weapon and cast spells, preferring something more flashy than a gunslinger’s long coat and more intimidating than typical magician or witch clothing.
  

### Connection
>1. Pick one other PC. You once grazed this character with one of your spell bullets; it’s up to them whether they’ve forgiven you or still resent you for it.
>2. Pick one other PC. You’ve accidentally discovered that you can shoot their spells out of your gun just like you do with your own spells, but the PC must be touching your gun while you fire it.
>3. Pick one other PC. Based on your interactions, you think this character resents your use of guns, magic, or both.
>4. Pick one other PC. This character can barely hear your gunshots (magical or otherwise), which are no louder than a whisper to them.
#### Additional Equipment
>Medium or heavy handgun.
#### Minor Effect Suggestion 
>The attack hits the side of the foe’s head, deafening them for a few minutes.
#### Major Effect Suggestion 
>The foe’s major blood vessel is hit, causing them to bleed 1 point of damage each round until someone succeeds at a difficulty 3 Intellect or Speed task to bind the wound.
