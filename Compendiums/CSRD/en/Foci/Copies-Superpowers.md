## Copies Superpowers  
You can copy others' skills, abilities, and superpowers.  
 ### Intrusion  
A copied power ends unexpectedly or goes out of control. A copied power doesn't bring secondary powers with it (like gaining superspeed without protection from air friction, or not being immune to the heat from your own fire bolts).
