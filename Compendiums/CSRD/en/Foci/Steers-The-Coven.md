## Steers The Coven  
The moon is a powerful force on the world, in terms of both science and magic. She hangs overhead like a watchful eye, makes creatures act strangely, represents cycles of time, and causes the ebb and flow of the tides. To you, she is a friend, an inspiration, and a constant reminder that someone is watching over you. You wield her magic to create beams of dangerous light, influence others, travel, and sense the underlying truth and reality of things. The day is not your foe (after all, the moon is often visible during the day), but you prefer the night when the moon can be the brightest light in the sky. You might call yourself a moonchild or a moon witch. You probably prefer black, white, or grey clothing, with lowing portions such as long sleeves, a cape, or a long coat. You might have one or more tattoos or tokens representing the moon, either full, crescent, or in multiple phases. Your favorite jewelry and adornments (like buttons) usually have moonstones.  
  
  
### Connection:   
>1. Pick one other PC. You have a friendly rivalry with this person, perhaps due to philosophical differences or belonging to another coven with contrary goals.  
>2. Pick one other PC. You want to learn more about this person so you can decide if they should join your coven or are somehow a threat to it.  
>3. Pick one other PC. Long ago you were very close to this character, but you drifted apart. You’ll need to decide if you’re starting anew or trying to rekindle the old friendship.  
>4. Pick one other PC. This character or someone they care about is in your coven, and you feel responsible for protecting them.  
### Minor Effect Suggestion   
>The evident power of the support from your coven intimidates a foe, who retreats a short distance away on their next turn.  
#### Major Effect Suggestion   
>Your opponent respects your commitment to your coven so much that they withdraw from the conflict (although they may return later).
