## Remembers the Past  
You are a student of the before-times. Maybe that's because you grew up in the ruins of an old library and read everything as your hobby, you found a friendly AI archivist who taught you about how things once were, you're long-lived and were alive before the apocalypse, or you have a deep recollection of the world before the end for some other reason. This knowledge gives you an appreciation of the before-times as well as a point of view that many other survivors lack that benefits you in and around ruins. You can find things others wouldn't know to look for, plucking fruits of the past that would otherwise go unharvested.  

>[!info]- Connections  
>Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.  
>- Pick one other PC. They remind you of someone you knew or learned about from the past, because of either the way they look or the way they act, and that is what first drew you to them.  
>- Pick one other PC. You saved their life because you found them trapped in a before-times ruin and you knew how best to free them.  
>- Pick one other PC. You were lost out past the ruins in the wilderness, but they happened across you and saved your life.  
>- Pick one other PC. This character comes from the same place you do, and you knew each other as children.  

>[!info] Effects  
>**Minor,** You remember something about the area that proves advantageous later, such as realizing there's probably a fresh location to scavenge close by that has a good chance of not having been picked over by other survivors.  
>**Major,** A foe forgets about you unless you draw attention to yourself.  

>[!info] Additional Equipment  
>One book on a technical topic such as plumbing, carpentry, electronics, or physics; it provides you an asset on a related task if you spend ten minutes perusing the book ahead of time.
