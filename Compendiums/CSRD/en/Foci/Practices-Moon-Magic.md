## Practices Moon Magic
The moon is a powerful force on the world, in terms of both science and magic. She hangs overhead like a watchful eye, makes creatures act strangely, represents cycles of time, and causes the ebb and flow of the tides. To you, she is a friend, an inspiration, and a constant reminder that someone is watching over you. You wield her magic to create beams of dangerous light, influence others, travel, and sense the underlying truth and reality of things. The day is not your foe (after all, the moon is often visible during the day), but you prefer the night when the moon can be the brightest light in the sky. You might call yourself a moonchild or a moon witch. You probably prefer black, white, or grey clothing, with lowing portions such as long sleeves, a cape, or a long coat. You might have one or more tattoos or tokens representing the moon, either full, crescent, or in multiple phases. Your favorite jewelry and adornments (like buttons) usually have moonstones.


### Connection: 
>1. Pick one other PC. You can harmlessly bounce your moon spells off them, increasing your range by a short distance and even allowing you to shoot around corners.
>2. Pick one other PC. You know they think your obsession with the moon is weird, pointless, or superstitious, and you feel the need to prove them wrong.
>3. Pick one other PC. Sometimes you can’t detect them with any of your senses or affect them with your magic, even when they’re right in front of you.
>4. Pick one other PC. Your power and theirs have an unusual connection; instead of using your one-action recovery roll on yourself, you can use it on them (and vice versa).
### Minor Effect Suggestion
>Your foe is dazzled by a burst of moonlight, hindering them for one round.
#### Major Effect Suggestion 
>A surge of lunar power knocks your foe prone and disarms them of an object they’re holding, which lands an immediate distance away.
