## Befriends the Black Dog
Everywhere you go, your black dog goes too. They are your best friend and your greatest weakness. Their shadowed presence fills you with a darkness, but it is inside that darkness that you find the strength to shine.

>[!note] Focus Note
>Your companion is a black dog of any size or shape. It can be any formâ€” living, dead, crafted (such as a puppet), pure shadow, and so on. Your black dog is a physical manifestation of depression, grief, sadness, or other heavy and dark emotions. But it is also a dog, and thus brings with it the unique companionship, comfort, and bond that only dogs can offer.
