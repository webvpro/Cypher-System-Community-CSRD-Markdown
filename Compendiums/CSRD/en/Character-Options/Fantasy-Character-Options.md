## Fantasy Character Options  
In some cases, the ideas here require minor changes to the flavor described in the character options; you should work with your GM to make sure these changes are suitable for the campaign. Most of the foci in this section appear in the Cypher System; foci with an asterisk (*) are found later in this document. Some of these options recommend swapping out a type ability for an ability from one of the character flavors such as combat, magic, or stealth.   
  
### Alchemist    
> In the sense that an alchemist is someone who makes magical items or similar types of things, [Adept](Adept.md) and [Explorer](Explorer.md) are appropriate type choices for academic alchemists. For a general sort of alchemist who makes potions of magical effects, choose the [Masters Spells](Masters-Spells.md) focus (instead of spells, you learn potions). For one who transforms into a powerful and dangerous creature, choose [Howls at the Moon](Howls-at-the-Moon.md) at the Moon. For one who loves throwing bombs, choose Bears a [Bears a Halo of Fire](Bears-a-Halo-of-Fire.md). For a healer, choose [Works Miracles](Works-Miracles.md).  
  
### Assassin/Spy    
> [Explorer](Explorer.md) and [Warrior](Warrior.md) are good type choices for an assassin character. Appropriate foci are [Masters Weaponry](Masters-Weaponry.md), [Moves Like a Cat](Moves-Like-a-Cat.md), [Murders](Murders.md), and [Works the Back Alleys](Works-the-Back-Alleys.md).     
  
### Barbarian    
>A barbarian character is probably a [Warrior](Warrior.md) or (to focus a little more on skills than combat) an [Explorer](Explorer.md). Good foci to choose from are [Lives in the Wilderness](Lives-in-the-Wilderness.md), [Masters Weaponry](Masters-Weaponry.md), [Needs No Weapon](Needs-No-Weapon.md), [Never Says Die](Never-Says-Die.md), [Performs Feats of Strength](Performs-Feats-of-Strength.md), and [Rages](Rages.md).     
  
###  Bard    
> Bards in fantasy fiction and games are troubadours, minstrels, and storytellers, perhaps with a supernatural element. Bards are usually [Explorers](Explorer.md) or [Speakers](Speaker.md). Appropriate foci are [Entertains](Entertains.md), [Helps Their Friends](Helps-Their-Friends.md), [Infiltrates](Infiltrates.md), and [Masters Spells](Masters-Spells.md).  
  
### Cleric or Priest    
 > Academic clerics are usually [Adepts](Adept.md) or [Speakers](Speaker.md), but martial clerics are often [Warriors](Warrior.md) (perhaps with [Magic Flavor](Magic-Flavor.md) ). For a typical cleric with a versatile set of abilities, choose the Channels Divine Blessings focus.    
 >  - **Cleric (death):** [Consorts with the Dead](Consorts-with-the-Dead.md), [Shepherds Spirits](Shepherds-Spirits.md)    
 >  - **Cleric (knowledge):** [Learns Quickly](Learns-Quickly.md), [Sees Beyond](Sees-Beyond.md), [Would Rather Be Reading](Would-Rather-Be-Reading.md)  
 >  - **Cleric (life):** [Defends the Weak](Defends-the-Weak.md), [Shepherds the Community](Shepherds-the-Community.md), [Works Miracles](Works-Miracles.md)    
 >  - **Cleric (light):** [Blazes with Radiance](Blazes-with-Radiance.md), [Channels Divine Blessings](Channels-Divine-Blessings.md)    
 >  - **Cleric (storm):** [Rides the Lightning](Rides-the-Lightning.md), [Thunders](Thunders.md)    
 >  - **Cleric (trickery):** [Takes Animal Shape*](Takes-Animal-Shape.md) (also see options for rogues)    
   
### Druid    
 > As a very specific sort of nature priest, a druid character is usually an [Adept](Adept.md) or [Explorer](Explorer.md) (in either case probably using the [Magic Flavor](Magic-Flavor.md)). A typical druid probably has [Channels Divine Blessings](Channels-Divine-Blessings.md) or [Lives in the Wilderness](Lives-in-the-Wilderness.md) as a focus, but for more specific options, see the following foci:     
 > - **Druid (animal companion):** [Controls Beasts](Controls-Beasts.md), [Masters the Swarm](Masters-the-Swarm.md)    
 > - **Druid (elemental):** [Abides in Stone](Abides-in-Stone.md), [Bears a Halo of Fire](Bears-a-Halo-of-Fire.md), [Moves Like the Wind](Moves-Like-the-Wind.md), [Rides the Lightning](Rides-the-Lightning.md), [Wears a Sheen of Ice](Wears-a-Sheen-of-Ice.md)   
 > - **Druid (nature affinity):** [Speaks for the Land](Speaks-for-the-Land.md)    
 > - **Druid (transformation):** [Abides in Stone](Abides-in-Stone.md), [Takes Animal Shape*](Takes-Animal-Shape.md), [Walks the Wild Woods*](Walks-the-Wild-Woods.md)  
    
   
### Fighter    
 > Fighters almost always have the [Warrior](Warrior.md) type, but some are [Explorers](Explorer.md). A typical fighter probably has a direct focus like [Masters Weaponry](Masters-Weaponry.md) or [Wields an Enchanted Weapon*](Wields-an-Enchanted-Weapon.md). For additional options based on choosing a specific fighting role, see the following:   
 > - **Fighter (guardian):** [Brandishes an Exotic Shield](Brandishes-an-Exotic-Shield.md), [Defends the Gate](Defends-the-Gate.md), [Masters Defense](Masters-Defense.md), [Never Says Die](Never-Says-Die.md), [Stands Like a Bastion](Stands-Like-a-Bastion.md).    
 > - **Fighter (melee):** [Fights Dirty](Fights-Dirty.md), [Fights with Panache](Fights-with-Panache.md), [Looks for Trouble](Looks-for-Trouble.md), [Needs No Weapon](Needs-No-Weapon.md), [Wields Two Weapons at Once](Wields-Two-Weapons-at-Once.md)    
 > - **Fighter (ranged):** [Is Licensed to Carry](Is-Licensed-to-Carry.md), [Throws with Deadly Accuracy](Throws-with-Deadly-Accuracy.md)     
  
### Gunslinger  
> A gunslinger is probably a [Warrior](Warrior.md) or [Explorer](Explorer.md), but some are [Speakers](Speaker.md) with [Combat Flavor](Combat-Flavor.md) . Appropriate foci are Is [Is Licensed to Carry](Is-Licensed-to-Carry.md), [Masters Weaponry](Masters-Weaponry.md), [Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger](Sailed-Beneath-the-Jolly-Roger.md), and [Wields an Enchanted Weapon*](Wields-an-Enchanted-Weapon.md).   
###  Inquisitor    
> Inquisitors are usually [Explorers](Explorer.md), [Speakers](Speaker.md), or [Warriors](Warrior.md)\, depending on whether their inclinations are for having many skills, being good at interacting with people, or combat. Appropriate foci are [Infiltrates](Infiltrates.md), [Metes Out Justice](Metes-Out-Justice.md), and [Operates Undercover](Operates-Undercover.md).     
  
###  Merchant    
> An [Explorer](Explorer.md) with a focus dealing with social interactions, like [Entertains](Entertains.md) or [Leads](Leads.md), would make a good merchant character, but the more obvious choice would be a [Speaker](Speaker.md).    
  
### Monk or Martial Artist    
> As masters of unarmed combat, monks are usually [Warriors](Warrior.md) or [Explorers](Explorer.md) (perhaps with a [Combat Flavor](Combat-Flavor.md)). Appropriate foci are [Fights with Panache](Fights-with-Panache.md), [Needs No Weapon](Needs-No-Weapon.md), and [Throws with Deadly Accuracy](Throws-with-Deadly-Accuracy.md).   
  
### Paladin/Holy Knight/Paragon    
> As holy warriors who mix martial prowess and magic, paladins are usually [Warriors](Warrior.md) or [Explorers](Explorer.md) (in either case, perhaps modified with the [Magic Flavor](Magic-Flavor.md)). Good foci for this type of character include [Defends the Gate](Defends-the-Gate.md), [Defends the Weak](Defends-the-Weak.md), [Metes Out Justice](Metes-Out-Justice.md), [Slays Monsters](Slays-Monsters.md), and [Wields an Enchanted Weapon*](Wields%20an%20Enchanted%20Weapon*.md).  
  
### Ranger   
> Rangers mix combat and skills, and therefore are usually [Explorers](Explorer.md) (perhaps with [Combat Flavor](Combat-Flavor.md)) or [Warriors](Warrior.md) (perhaps with skills and [Skills and Knowledge Flavor](Skills-and-Knowledge-Flavor.md)). Appropriate foci for a ranger are [Controls Beasts](Controls-Beasts.md), [Hunts](Hunts.md), [Lives in the Wilderness](Lives-in-the-Wilderness.md), [Slays Monsters](Slays-Monsters.md), [Throws with Deadly Accuracy](Throws-with-Deadly-Accuracy.md), and [Wields Two Weapons at Once](Wields-Two-Weapons-at-Once.md).     
  
### Rogue or Thief    
> Most rogue-type characters are [Explorers](Explorer.md), but an interaction-focused rogue could easily be a [Speaker](Speaker.md) (perhaps with [Stealth Flavor](Stealth-Flavor.md)). Good foci for rogues are [Explores Dark Places](Explores-Dark-Places.md), [Fights Dirty](Fights-Dirty.md), [Hunts](Hunts.md), [Infiltrates](Infiltrates.md), [Is Wanted by the Law](Is-Wanted-by-the-Law.md), [Moves Like a Cat](Moves-Like-a-Cat.md), [Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger](Sailed-Beneath-the-Jolly-Roger.md), and [Works the Back Alleys](Works-the-Back-Alleys.md).  
  
 ### Sorcerer    
 >  Sorcerers, for our purpose here, are mages who have inherent magical abilities (as opposed to wizards, who study long and hard to get their spells). Most sorcerers are [Adepts](Adept.md) but some are [Explorers](Explorer.md) or [Speakers](Speaker.md). The [Masters Spells](Masters-Spells.md) focus gives a typical sorcerer an effective set of abilities, and most foci choices provide a themed set of spells. For sorcerers of various magical bloodlines, see the following:     
 > -  **Sorcerer (angel):** [Blazes with Radiance](Blazes-with-Radiance.md), [Channels Divine Blessings](Channels-Divine-Blessings.md), [Keeps a Magic Ally](Keeps-a-Magic-Ally.md)   
 >  -  **Sorcerer (destiny):** [Descends From Nobility](Descends-From-Nobility.md), [Was Foretold](Was-Foretold.md)  
 >  -	**Sorcerer (dragon):** [Bears a Halo of Fire](Bears-a-Halo-of-Fire.md), [Rides the Lightning](Rides-the-Lightning.md), [Wears a Sheen of Ice](Wears-a-Sheen-of-Ice.md)    
 >  -	**Sorcerer (elemental):** [Abides in Stone](Abides-in-Stone.md), [Bears a Halo of Fire](Bears-a-Halo-of-Fire.md), [Employs Magnetism](Employs-Magnetism.md), [Moves Like the Wind](Moves-Like-the-Wind.md), [Rides the Lightning](Rides-the-Lightning.md), [Wears a Sheen of Ice](Wears-a-Sheen-of-Ice.md)   
 >  -	**Sorcerer (fey):** [Takes Animal Shape*](Takes-Animal-Shape.md)   
 >  -	**Sorcerer (fiend):** [Bears a Halo of Fire](Bears-a-Halo-of-Fire.md), [Keeps a Magic Ally](Keeps-a-Magic-Ally.md)   
 >  -	**Sorcerer (undead):** [Consorts with the Dead](Consorts-with-the-Dead.md), [Shepherds Spirits](Shepherds-Spirits.md)  
   
###  Trickster or Con Artist    
> These clever folks are typically [Speakers](Speaker.md), although they could be [Adepts](Adept.md) if they are very magical (or Explorers if they aren’t magical at all). Foci choices include [Fights Dirty](Fights-Dirty.md), [Works the Back Alleys](Works-the-Back-Alleys.md), or [Entertains](Entertains.md).     
  
### War-wizard    
> For those unusual characters who use a mix of weapon attacks and spells, play a [Warrior](Warrior.md) with [Magic Flavor](Magic-Flavor.md) or an Expert with [Combat Flavor](Combat-Flavor.md) or [Magic Flavor](Magic-Flavor.md). Appropriate foci include [Fights with Panache](Fights-with-Panache.md), [Masters Weaponry](Masters-Weaponry.md), and [Wields an Enchanted Weapon](Wields-an-Enchanted-Weapon.md)*.     
  
###  Warlock or Witch  
> For the purposes of this list, warlocks and witches are mages who gain magical power from pacts they make with otherworldly entities. Most warlocks are [Adepts](Adept.md)\, but [Explorers](Explorer.md) and [Speakesr](Speaker.md) (perhaps with [Magic Flavor](Magic-Flavor.md)) can be interesting options. Fun foci for a warlock include [Dances with Dark Matter](Dances-with-Dark-Matter.md), [Keeps a Magic Ally](Keeps-a-Magic-Ally.md), [Masters the Swarm](Masters-the-Swarm.md), [Separates Mind From Body](Separates-Mind-From-Body.md), and [Was Foretold](Was-Foretold.md), but (depending on the patron and pact) most sorcerer and wizard foci work just as well.   
  
### Wild Mage    
> Those who use chaotic magic are usually [Adepts](Adept.md), but a dabbler might be an [Explorer](Explorer.md) or [Speakers](Speaker.md) with the [Magic Flavor](Magic-Flavor.md). The best focus that suits this theme is [Uses Wild Magic](Uses-Wild-Magic.md)*.  
  
### Wizard    
> For the purposes of this list, wizards study magical lore at length to learn the ways of spellcasting (as opposed to sorcerers, warlocks, and so on). Wizards are usually [Adepts](Adept.md), but a person-oriented wizard might be a [Speaker](Speaker.md) (perhaps with the [Magic Flavor](Magic-Flavor.md)). For a generalist wizard who has a variety of spells, choose the [Masters Spells](Masters-Spells.md) focus. For more specific kinds of wizards, see the following:    
> -	Wizard (abjurer): [Absorbs Energy](Absorbs-Energy.md), [Focuses Mind over Matter](Focuses-Mind-over-Matter.md), [Wears a Sheen of Ice](Wears-a-Sheen-of-Ice.md)   
> -	Wizard (conjurer or summoner): [Controls Beasts](Controls-Beasts.md), [Keeps a Magic Ally](Keeps-a-Magic-Ally.md)   
> -	Wizard (diviner): [Learns Quickly](Learns-Quickly.md), [Sees Beyond](Sees-Beyond.md),  [Separates Mind From Body](Separates-Mind-From-Body.md), [Solves Mysteries](Solves-Mysteries.md)    
> - Wizard (enchanter): [Commands Mental Powers](Commands-Mental-Powers.md), [Leads](Leads.md)   
> -	Wizard (evoker): [Bears a Halo of Fire](Bears-a-Halo-of-Fire.md), [Blazes with Radiance](Blazes-with-Radiance.md), [Rides the Lightning](Rides-the-Lightning.md), [Thunders](Thunders.md), [Wears a Sheen of Ice](Wears-a-Sheen-of-Ice.md)   
> -	Wizard (illusionist): [Awakens Dreams](Awakens-Dreams.md), [Crafts Illusions](Crafts-Illusions.md)   
> -	Wizard (necromancer): [Consorts with the Dead](Consorts-with-the-Dead.md), [Shepherds Spirits](Shepherds%20Spirits.md)   
> -	Wizard (transmuter): [Controls Gravity](Controls-Gravity.md), [Focuses Mind over Matter](Focuses-Mind-over-Matter.md), [Takes Animal Shape](Takes-Animal-Shape.md)*  
  
### Prepared Vs. Spontaneous Spellcasting    
>Magical characters get their abilities (which might be spells, rituals, or something else) from their type and focus, and they can use these abilities as they see fit as long as they spend the required Pool points. This technically makes them more like spontaneous casters. If you’d like to play something more like a prepared-caster wizard with a large selection of abilities that you narrow down each day, consider a spellcasting-oriented focus like Channels Divine Blessings, Masters Spells, or Speaks for the Land, and consider augmenting it with the optional spellcasting rule.

### Fantasy Species   
For many fantasy worlds, there is a plethora of sapient creatures suitable for player characters. Here we present additional options, which a player can choose for their character in place of their descriptor  
  
#### Variant Rule: Two Descriptors  
By having dwarf, elf, or other species take the place of a character’s descriptor, it creates a situation where only human characters have the variability of choosing a descriptor that suits their personality. The GM might instead allow all human characters to have two descriptors, and nonhuman characters to have a standard descriptor in addition to their species descriptor.  
  
>Sometimes contradictory descriptors might weaken or negate each other’s benefits and drawbacks. If one descriptor gives training in a skill and another gives an inability in that skill, they cancel each other out and the character doesn’t have any modifier for that skill at all.  
  
#### Descriptors As Species  
If a player wants to play a nearly human species without any exceptional or unique special abilities, it’s easy for a GM to pick an appropriate descriptor and use it as that species’ descriptor. A greyhound-like species might have the Fast descriptor.  
>[Catfolk](Catfolk.md)  
>[Dragonfolk](Dragonfolk.md)  
>[Gnome](Gnome.md)  
>[Halfling](Halfling.md)  
>[Lizardfolk](Lizardfolk.md)
