## Post-Apocalyptic-Character-Options

### Alternate Character Roles
Characters who play out the apocalypse itself or who have just survived it and must pick up a few hours, days, or months after the end should choose from an alternate slate of roles. If you begin your game in such a setting, it makes much more sense to let your players choose roles for characters in a modern game.

### Descriptors  
In addition to the descriptors in the Cypher System Rulebook, you can widen the options 
available to the players, allowing them to choose from the descriptors presented here for 
their characters. A subset of the descriptors in this chapter are species descriptors, which 
may or may not be appropriate for your players, depending on your setting.

#### Rust and Redemption Descriptors

>[!note]
>The Scavenges focus can be used as written in the Cypher System Rulebook, but whenever the abilities point to the scavenging rules and tables from the rulebook (including Ruin Lore, Junkmonger, Know Where to Look, and other abilities), use the optional rule for scavenging, repairing, and building in this book instead.

### Foci  
This section presents new post-apocalyptic foci that can be used as-is in most games set after civilization falls. As these were created specifically for the post-apocalyptic genre, each has an expanded description with more story details than the foci in the Cypher System Rulebook (which have short, broad descriptions suitable for other genres).
