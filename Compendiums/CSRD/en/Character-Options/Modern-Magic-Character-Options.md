## Modern Magic Character Options
### Descriptors
Most of these descriptors are for characters who are or become significantly nonhuman
nonhuman; for example, the Dragon descriptor means you’re a four-legged, winged dragon who can breathe flame. These descriptors include suggestions for how to advance or improve your inherent nature as that sort of creature (becoming even more dragonish if you are a Dragon, for example). The GM should allow a character with such a descriptor to choose any of these abilities (and any others the GM feels are appropriate for the descriptor) in place of a type ability, either upon advancing to a new tier or selecting them as an other option of character advancement by spending 4 XP.

#### It’s Only Magic Descriptors

#### Foci and Character Abilities
This section presents new foci that can be used as-is in most modern fantasy campaigns. Each of them has an expanded description with more story details than the foci in the Cypher System Rulebook (which have short, broad descriptions suitable for other genres). The GM and player should adjust these details to suit the specific campaign they’ll be playing.

The archetypes suggest how to assign your power shifts. This is an important aspect of designing your hero because power shifts are what make your characters exceptional in a “supers” way. Superheroes are known for being faster, tougher, stronger, or smarter than regular people, and that sort of comparison isn’t always part of the abilities you get from your type or focus. A regular person might be very skilled at martial arts, but a superhero martial artist might punch through an iron door, dodge a burst of bullets from a machine gun at close range, or quickly recover from a mortal wound, all thanks to power shifts. This part of each archetype writeup assumes your hero starts with five power shifts, but most archetype descriptions give only two or three suggestions, allowing you some flexibility to customize your superhero. For example, a master athlete with two power shifts in healing is a very different character than one with two power shifts in resilience.

>In some cases, you might need to tinker with the aesthetics of the abilities described in the character options to make them fit your character. 

#### Power Source
As you’re figuring out what type, descriptor, focus, and power shifts you want for
your character, think about how you got your powers. Are you a mutant, born with special abilities? Do you have a high-tech costume with built-in nanotechnology? Are you a sorcerer, or maybe a psychic? The source of your powers is character flavor—for example, there’s no game mechanics difference between the mental powers of an alien member of a telepathic species, a human character who built a brain-augmenting helmet, or a faerie character from the starlight dimension who knows mind-magic. All three of those characters could have the same type, focus, descriptor, and power shifts, but they’d be very different people and have very different reasons for being a part of the RPG campaign.

>If you can’t decide how you got your powers, or if you like leaving some things up to chance, try rolling once or twice on the Power Origin table and pick the result that you like better, or combine the two into something weird and unique.

#### Starting Just Past Tier 1
An interesting option for a GM starting a superhero campaign is to immediately give each PC 4 XP, which they must spend on a special advancement option to gain another type ability. It’s another way (along with power shifts) to make new superhero PCs feel a cut above player characters in other genres—and gives players a little more wiggle room in building the character they want to play.

#### Random Superpowers
The following table has a broad selection of powers (or in some cases, sets of related powers). Players who are stuck for ideas about their superhero can roll once or twice on the table for inspiration; use the Example column for a suggested game example of that kind of power, whether that’s a power shift, a hero archetype, a focus, or a specific special ability (of course, these suggestions aren’t the only way to achieve that power).
The GM can also use this table to come up with random abilities for supervillains. However, there is much more leeway in designing NPC abilities, so the Example column is more for suggesting game mechanics than abilities to choose.
