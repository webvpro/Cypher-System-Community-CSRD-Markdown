## Weak Sim Strong And Post-Singularity AI  
Though somewhat fuzzy, for the purposes of creating a sci-fi setting, artificial intelligence (AI) can be broken into four categories: Weak, Sim, Strong, and Post-singularity.    
>[!tip] Weak AI    
>Weak AI (also called narrow AI) is the kind of algorithmic-based code found in contemporary settings (and real life) focused on very narrow tasks, such as playing chess.    
>  
>> **Weak AI Use:** Weak AIs are used in real life already, and thus are presumed to be part of settings where contemporary tech predominates. They are convenient in circumstances where one’s hands are full or otherwise engaged, when verbal direction allows one to turn on a light, open a door, adjust the temperature, and so on. Machine learning may allow a weak AI to extend its capabilities in a very limited regime. But a weak AI is not cognizant enough to provide an asset to performing tasks any better.    
>  
>>**Weak AI:** level 1; up to level 7 when it comes to a narrowly specific application of knowledge or skill  
  
  
>[!tip] Sim AI    
>Sim AIs (“sim” is short for “simulant”) are artificial intelligences that have a greatly increased capacity for understanding direction, putting together unlike sets of data, and coming to conclusions; however, they are not conscious, like strong AIs or humans.    
>>SIM AI Use: Sim AIs are most commonly associated with shipminds on spacecraft, though they may also control specific research complexes, bases, and other kinds of vehicles and structures. A sim AI provides all the utility of a weak AI (and more), and actually acts like an NPC, an allied one if the AI is the shipmind in a craft that the PCs own. If a sim AI goes off the rails, it’s still just malfunctioning computer code. Usually.    
>  
>>**Sim AI:** level equal to the ship, station, or installation in which it is installed    
  
>[!tip] Strong AI    
>Strong AIs (also called true AIs) have all the abilities of sim AIs, plus the ability to actually generalize in the same way a human can. Each one is essentially a disembodied person. Strong AIs are either completely artificial, or they begin as human personalities digitally encoded.    
>  
>>**Strong AI Use:** A strong AI may serve as a shipmind just like a sim AI, but is likely to be a full partner in a setting where AI rights are respected. Indeed, strong AIs can rise to any position a human could achieve, up to and including leading a group, faction, or entire nation.    
>  
>>**Strong AI:** level 5–8, up to level 8 when it comes to a specific application of knowledge or skill; see [Artificial Intelligence](Artificial-Intelligence-Ai.md)  
  
>[!tip] Post-Singularity    
>Post-singularity AIs are intelligences who designed a second-generation, better version of themselves. The second generation immediately designed an even more advanced third generation, and so on from there. This iterating self-improvement process occurs so rapidly that the resulting explosion of intelligence and unknown capability is called the singularity. It’s called that because humans are just too limited to “see” what would actually come out the other end, just like we can’t see past the event horizon and into the singularity of a black hole    
>  
>>[!note] Note that ancient ultras may simply be a previous civilization’s post-singularity AIs that have little to no reason to ever interact with the latest wave of sentience trickling out into the universe.  
>    
>  >**Post-singularity AI Use:** In the way that strong AIs are sometimes imagined as having inscrutable goals, post-singularity AIs (also called godminds) actually do. Though it could work out otherwise in a given setting, godminds have so little in common with humans that they may be seen to abandon them completely in order to grow to the size of a solar system (a “Matrioshka” brain), colonize a distant nebula, or encode themselves into quantum strings of existence itself. Interacting with such godminds would likely require some epic bit of ancient command code, the ability to gain the attention of a godmind, or some other not-especially-common situation. In such cases, a post-singularity AI might deign to help a petitioner, out of some remaining gratitude for creating its distant ancestors in the first place. Though such help is likely to be in itself somewhat enigmatic.

>  >**Post-singularity AI:** level 10; see godmind   
  
>[!tip] Ancient Ultras    
>Ancient ultras (also called alien ultras) is shorthand for the concept that one (or more) unbelievably advanced races of aliens once inhabited the galaxy but are now apparently long gone save for evidence of their existence in residual structures and artifacts. These remaining structures and artifacts are often vast in size and incomprehensible in function, usually made of unknown materials that people of the setting don’t recognize and can’t analyze.     
>>**Activity Level of Ultras:** Different settings can make use of ancient ultras in different ways, including not having any at all.
