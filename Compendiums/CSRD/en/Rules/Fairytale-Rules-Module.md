# Fairytale Rules Module

## Special Rules
Fairy tale games have unique opportunities for magic that aren’t found elsewhere— death, curses, blessings, and wishes are all prevalent in fairy tales and make interesting elements in games. Here are some suggested ways to handle them.
### Death
You’ve probably noticed that in fairy tales, characters die all the time. Or almost die. Or sleep forever instead of die. Or die and come back to life. You get the idea.

Potentially, this will also be true in a fairy tale game. Thankfully, death doesn’t have to be the end of a character’s life. There are any number of ways to stop or reverse death, including artifacts, cyphers, and abilities. Additionally, a few NPCs, such as witches or Death themself, may have the power to bring someone back from the dead.

Typically, though, if a character dies and chooses to stay dead (or is unable to find a way to return to life), they are dead—they no longer have bodies, abilities, Pools, and so on. They can communicate to the living only through magic. Someone may stay dead for up to about a year (in game time) and still return to life. After that time elapses, death is permanent.
### Curses
In fairy tale games, curses are likely to be common. Most witches can cast curses of one form or another, as can many fey beings, queens, and sea creatures. Even objects and places can cause a character to become cursed. Characters might have multiple curses on them at the same time. 

All curses have a level, from 1 to 10. The level affects how hard it is to resist the curse, as well as how severe the effects are and how difficult it is to remove the curse.

Curses work slightly differently than regular damage. Curses can have an impact on the game and the game mechanics (a character is turned into a fish or becomes invisible, all of their interactions are hindered, they take ongoing damage, and so on), or they can have more of a roleplaying impact (a character looks much older, they forget the word “apple,” their skin turns golden). See the Curse table for a list of example curses.
#### Preventing Curses 
When a character attempts to resist being cursed, they must make an Intellect defense roll against the level of the curse being cast. Being trained in Intellect defense eases
this task, as does having a skill in curses or resisting curses.
Often, part of a curse’s effects is hindering curse resistance; thus, a character who already has one curse on them will find defending against a second curse is more difficult (their task is hindered).
#### Removing Curses 
Similar to poison and disease, curses aren’t automatically removed when a character makes a regular recovery roll. Instead, they stick around, continuing to affect the PC long after the curse is cast. In order to rid themselves of a curse, the character must take actions to remove it. The actions required depend on the nature and level of the curse.
The easiest way to remove a curse is to find, buy, steal, borrow, or otherwise acquire an object that removes curses (such as the blood pearl blossom cypher). Alternatively, the character might be able to pay someone who is skilled in curse removal to do the deed.
#### Curse Intrusions and Curse Mode 
In addition to dealing with the original effect of the curse, a cursed character is more likely to have bad things happen to them. There are two ways for the GM to work this into the game: curse intrusions and Curse Mode. Ideally, you’ll want to use both of these, as they each add something unique to the experience of being cursed.
>Curse intrusions work like regular GM intrusions, and the cursed character gets XP. However, they only get 1 XP instead of the usual 2, and they must decide whether to keep it or give it to another player. Introduce additional curse intrusions from the Curse Intrusions table when it feels appropriate. This might be anytime the character has a big success, when they’re in a particularly risky position, or when they start to feel like they’ve forgotten about the curse.

##### Curse Mode 
When using this rule, the GM increases the range of numbers that trigger a GM intrusion. As soon as a character is cursed, every time they roll a 1 or a 2 (instead of just a 1), they trigger a GM intrusion. As time passes, GM intrusions happen on a roll of 1 to 3, then a roll of 1 to 4, and so on. This potentially means that a die roll in Curse Mode can indicate success i a task and still trigger a GM intrusion. Curse Mode is similar to the Horror Mode optional rule in the Cypher System Rulebook, with one exception: the escalation works at a much slower pace. This is because Curse Mode is not designed to heighten immediate tension, but rather to create a long-term sense of being saddled with an unwanted and unpredictable negative effect.

 ###### Typically, the intrusion range is increased by 1 when
 > - The character is cursed.
 > - The character starts a new day (or makes their ten-hour recovery roll).
 > - The character actively takes an action to remove the curse (curses like wreaking havoc, which is part of the reason they’re so hard to get rid of).
 > - The character attempts to resist an additional curse being cast upon them.
 >Once all curses are removed, Curse Mode is no longer in effect.
While not all regular GM intrusions are necessarily bad for the character, curse intrusions always make the cursed PC’s situation worse.

###### Curse Intrusions

|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | An insect stings or bites the character at just the wrong moment.       |
| 2  | Something in the area makes the character sneeze loudly and repeatedly. |
| 3  | The character shimmers in and out of view.                              |
| 4  | A deep sense of despair comes over the character.                       |
| 5  | The character feels an overwhelming urge to start dancing.              |
| 6  | The character’s clothes are suddenly much too large.                    |

###### Curse Table 
Roll 1d20 on the Curse table to determine the effect of the curse, or choose one that feels appropriate to the situation and the characters.

Typically, curses that have simple roleplaying effects (such as the character’s inability to speak their own name) are lower-level curses, while those that affect gameplay (such as decreasing recovery roll points) are higher level. Curses that have multiple effects are likely the highest level of all. However, sometimes an incredibly simple curse is still very high level because the caster wants to make it very hard to get rid of.

| D20 | Effect                                                           |

| 18  | Moves slowly (effort on Speed tasks costs +1 Speed)              |

| 20  | No one else remembers or recognizes the character                |

###### Curse Removal Table 
Some curses have a specific way that they must be removed. Others can be removed in a variety of ways. You can use the table as a reference for ways to remove or undo a curse, or you can roll 1d10 to give a curse a specific method of removal.
There are also many artifacts, cyphers, and other objects in the world that will remove (or prevent) curses.

| d10 | Removal Process                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Complete an important task for the one who cursed you.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2   | Complete an important task for (or make a large payment to) someone who promises to remove your curse.                                                                                                    |
| 3   | Make things right (return the stolen item, apologize, or undo whatever was done to cause the curse to happen in the first place).                                                                           |
| 4   | Write the name of the curse on a scrap of paper, bind it in a cloth with an egg, bury it at a crossroads, and never look back.                                                                             |
| 5   | Pass the curse to someone else (this typically requires learning how the curse was done and then passing it to another person in the same way but there are also more creative ways to make this happen). |
| 6   | Collect five birds, five beetles, five cats, five fish, and five young winds.                                                                                                                                 |
| 7   | Die and return to life which usually (but not always) takes advantage of a loophole that says death will end a curse.                                                                                     |
| 8   | Take three golden leaves from a golden tree to make tea with; drink the tea and read the leaves; then complete the task they suggest.                                                                     |
| 9   | Kill the one who cast the curse (or otherwise find a way for them to die).                                                                                                                                |
| 10  | Find a poem of which there is only one written copy, read it backward each morning for seven mornings in a row, and then burn the item upon which the poem is written.                                     |


###### Blessings 
When someone is blessed, it typically means that they are more likely to receive a beneficial GM intrusion when they roll a 1 (or when the GM deems it appropriate to give them an intrusion). The Blessing Intrusions table provides examples of positive GM intrusions that a blessed character might receive.
###### Blessing Intrusions 
| d6 | Blessing                                                           |
|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Someone randomly gives the character a small gift.                 |
| 2  | When the character speaks, gold coins fall from their mouth.       |
| 3  | A necessary item, map, or clue falls into the character’s lap.     |
| 4  | The weather is suddenly in the character’s favor.                  |
| 5  | Someone nearby just happens to have the thing the character needs. |
| 6  | A cypher or artifact works even better than expected.              |

### Wishes 
Wishes can be granted via objects, creatures such as genies, or as part of a bargain. When the character asks for a wish, the GM assigns it a level. The larger and more difficult the wish, the higher the level. Generally, a wish such as gaining an asset or inexpensive item is level 1, and a wish for an expensive item or for a foe to vanish is level 7.

In order for a wish to be granted, the character must succeed on an Intellect-related task (usually persuasion or possibly intimidation) equal to the wish’s level. On a failed roll, the wish is either not granted at all or is partially granted, depending on the wish and the creature or object that is granting it.

Even if a wish is granted, the character may not get exactly what they want, especially if the wish is poorly worded, has multiple interpretations, or asks for something that is utterly impossible (such as destroying the entire world).

### GM Intrusions
GM intrusions present fantastic opportunities to imbue fairy tale games with a bit more weirdness, wonder, and whimsy, all while making the game more interesting and surprising for characters.

There’s a list of example GM intrusions in the Cypher System Rulebook, and any of those would work in a fairy tale game. The GM intrusions included in this section are more specifically designed with fairy tale magic in mind—they’re what could happen when magic goes wrong (or extraordinarily right).

Remember that GM intrusions don’t always mean that something has gone wrong or is bad for the players (unless they are curse intrusions). A GM intrusion could be the arrival of a good omen, the sudden reversal of a curse, or something that seems bad at first (like falling down a rabbit hole) but leads to something wonderful in the end (a whole new world to explore!).

The Fairy Tale Intrusions tables are ways to quickly generate intrusions appropriate to a fairy tale aesthetic. Roll on the appropriate table to determine the intrusion that occurs, or choose one that feels right for the situation.
Interaction Intrusions

| d10 | GM Intrusion                                                                                                                             |

| 1   | A mischievous brownie attempts to steal an object from the characters in the middle of an important conversation or fight.               |
| 2   | The NPC that the characters are talking to suddenly looks at their watch or the sky, says, “I’m late, I’m late,” and disappears.         |
| 3   | A character speaks and all of their words come out backward.                                                                             |
| 4   | The creature that the PCs are fighting or interacting with splits into two versions of itself.                                           |
| 5   | The character that the PCs have been interacting with loses their glamour, and the PCs discover it’s not the person they thought it was. |
| 6   | Death arrives, convinced that one of the characters is someone else.                                                                     |

| 9   | One of the PCs inadvertently (or purposefully) offends someone, and they are instantly turned into a frog.                               |
| 10  | An opponent holds up a mirror or other reflective surface at just the right moment, reflecting a spell or ability back on the character. |

#### World Intrusions
| d10 | GM Intrusion                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | One or more characters accidentally damage or offend a plant of some type, causing it to retaliate.                                                                    |
| 2   | A wren starts singing at a nearby crossroads, warning that something’s coming.                                                                                         |
| 3   | One of the characters trips and falls into a rabbit hole.                                                                                                              |
| 4   | Someone steals the moon just as the PCs are about to do an important task that requires moonlight.                                                                     |
| 5   | The tree that the characters are sitting under wakes up. Perhaps it is hungry, or maybe it just wants company.                                                         |
| 6   | The path that the characters have been following turns into a rushing river beneath their feet.                                                                        |
| 7   | Someone casting a curse nearby accidentally catches one of the characters in the magic, causing them to be affected (roll on the Curse table to determine the effect). |
| 8   | A mountain rises up suddenly between the place where the characters stand and the place they need to get to.                                                           |
| 9   | Somewhere far off, a magical effect backfires, causing a stampede of wild animals to run right toward the characters.                                                  |
| 10  | One of the characters smells gingerbread. The scent is so tempting, they have a hard time turning away from it.                                                        |

#### Item Intrusions
| d10 | GM Intrusion                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | A magical ability, cypher, or artifact does exactly what it’s supposed to, but also creates a weird side effect that affects a nearby friend (or foe).                   |
| 2   | A piece of equipment whispers lies into the character’s ear, making a convincing argument that their friends are not loyal.                                            |
| 3   | A magical weapon breaks in the middle of combat and starts to cry.                                                                                                    |
| 4   | A character’s belt turns into a snake and starts tightening around their middle.                                                                                      |
| 5   | A random object begins to wiggle and crack, as though it’s about to hatch.                                                                                             |
| 6   | The character’s weapon or armor begins to yell loudly for help while the PC is trying to sneak or hide.                                                               |
| 7   | A previously opened box, bottle, jar, or other container has locked itself back up, with an important item inside.                                                    |
| 8   | A cypher, artifact, or bit of magic is far more powerful than the characters realized, and affects a much larger area (or has a bigger effect) than they expected it to. |
| 9   | The glint of a recently acquired object or weapon is so shiny, it attracts the attention of a giant bird, beast, or dragon.                                              |
| 10  | An item in the character’s hand or bag starts to replicate itself over and over.                                                                                      |

### Playing in a Fairy Tale Game
#### Player Intrusions
A player intrusion occurs when a player chooses to alter something in the story, making things easier for a player character. It’s kind of a reverse GM intrusion: instead of the GM giving the player XP and introducing an unexpected complication for a character, the player spends 1 XP and presents a solution to a problem or complication.

##### Once Upon a Time
>Someone you played with as a child reappears and helps you in whatever you are doing. They may be alive or dead, but your heart is warmed upon seeing them, for it’s been a long time.
##### As You Wish
>You do something that reminds another person or creature in the area of someone they once cared for deeply. They are eager to assist you in whatever you’ve got going on, at least for a few minutes.
##### Once Upon a Dream
>Not long ago, you dreamt of a scenario similar to the one that you find yourself in now. You can’t remember all of the details, but you remember enough to know some of what’s about to take place, and it gives you an additional action to prepare something useful.
##### Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
>A little sprinkle of magic from your fairy godmother is all you need to achieve a goal, retry a task, or be better at something you’re attempting to do.
##### Wish Upon a Star
>Long ago, you helped part of a dying star return to its rightful place in the sky. It keeps an eye on you and, in a moment when it feels like all hope is lost, it sends a little magic or light to aid you.
##### Dreams Do Come True
>Something you wished for long ago comes true just at this moment. It might be for a broken weapon to be fixed, an ally to appear, or a bit of knowledge or understanding to arrive in your mind.
##### What’s Come to Pass
>Not long ago, someone forewarned you of the exact scenario that you find yourself in now. You know just what to do to put yourself at an advantage in the situation.
##### Think Happy Thoughts
>You think of something or someone that brings you great joy, and it imbues your next few actions with magic, allowing you to fly or do some other thing that you are normally unable to do.
>I Can Show You the World
>>Something or someone in the area shows itself to you, highlighting a route you were looking for, an object you had lost, or an answer to a problem.
##### Happily Ever After
>Through the power of your love for another, you use magic to protect someone you care for. They are able to sidestep an attack that would normally do them grave damage.

If a player has no XP to spend, they can’t use a player intrusion.
#### Minor and Major Special Effect Options 
Any time a PC attempts an action and rolls a natural 19 or 20, they have the option
of triggering a minor special effect or major special effect, respectively. In fairy tales, almost anything goes, which can be overwhelming to a player trying to decide what their character’s special effect might be. Here are a few special effect options for players to use or be inspired by.
##### Minor Effect Suggestions 
>- A weapon comes alive at the perfect moment and does a bit more damage to a foe.
>- A fluctuation in magic hinders all of the foe’s tasks for one minute.
>- A curse, spell, or ability has additional force behind it, and lasts a round longer than expected.
>- The foe’s magical armor begins to dissipate, decreasing the amount of protection it offers on the next attack.
>- A shapeshifting or disguise spell or ability dazzles the target, easing all tasks related to it.
>- A magical attack hits the target and something they were holding, causing damage to both.
##### Major Effect Suggestions 
>- A weapon comes alive at the perfect moment and does a lot more damage to a foe.
>- A fluctuation in magic prevents a foe from taking their next action.
>- A curse that was cast upon you by the foe you’re attacking is removed.
>- A foe surrenders, agreeing to lay down their weapons.
>- A foe accidentally steps on a living plant or dangerous creature while trying to dodge your blow, and it attacks them or holds them fast.
>- A shapeshifting or disguise spell or ability works so well that the foe’s familiar or companion runs off, afraid to continue the fight.

#### Creating Your Character
##### Form Vs. Function
>In a fairy tale game, the PCs might consist of a talking fox, an ogre, a fairy, and a human the size of your thumb. And that’s perfectly fine. Build your character sentence in a way that plays to your character’s strengths and weaknesses, and the rest can be handled through story and narrative. Playing a talking bear, a gingerbread man, or a changeling will likely affect your character’s appearance, their outlook on life, and their backstory, but it doesn’t necessarily affect their abilities, skills, and Pools beyond what you choose during character creation.
>
>Because the form that you choose doesn’t typically offer you something in addition to your Cypher System stats—being small, for example, does not inherently mean you’re stealthy—you’ll want to choose your stats to emphasize the bit of your character that you want to play.
##### Skills
As described in the Cypher System Rulebook, there is no definitive list of skills. Characters can choose to become skilled in anything they like (with the GM’s permission). In addition to the suggested skills in the rulebook, useful skills for fairy tale games might include: 
• Talking animals*
• Talking nature*
• Trickery
• Using magic 
• Weather
• Baking
• Cobbling 
• Curses
• Dancing 
• Death
• Magic
• Playing an instrument 
• Puzzles
• Riddles
• Sailing
• Sensing magic 
• Singing
Remember that only skills gained through character type abilities or in other rare instances allow you to become skilled with attack or defense tasks. Thus, all magic skills are noncombat skills only.

>* These skills could be used in a number of different ways, depending on the setting. If the setting has talking animals that the players can’t understand, the talking animals skill could help a PC communicate with them in other ways. If there are talking animals that the characters can understand, the skill could provide an asset in social interactions.

##### Type
Your character’s type is the core of who they are and how they interact with their environment, their companions, and other living creatures they encounter.

###### Adjusted Foci
[[Battles-Robots|Battles Robots]], [[Builds-Robots|Builds Robots]], [[Talks-to-Machines|Talks to Machines]]
Best for settings that include elements of science fiction. Alternatively, “robots” can be a stand-in for puppets, steampunk entities, golems, or other creations such as Pinocchio, Edward Scissorhands, the Gingerbread Man, and the Tin Man. Mister Geppetto would likely be someone who Builds Robots, while Muska (from Miyazaki’s film Laputa: Castle in the Sky) might be someone who Battles Robots.

[[Drives-Like-a-Maniac|Drives Like a Maniac]]
Best for modern settings or those where traditional fairy tale vehicles such as horse-drawn carriages, magic carpets, witch’s brooms, and chicken-legged huts are common.

[[Fuses-Flesh-and-Steel|Fuses Flesh and Steel]], [[Fuses-Mind-and-Machine|Fuses Mind and Machine]]
Best for steampunk or weird science mashups. Edward Scissorhands and the Tin Man are probably characters who Fuse Flesh and Steel. Alternatively, renaming the foci to Fuses Flesh and Magic or Wants to Become a Real Boy can provide characters with the same benefits from a more magical-sounding source.

[[Is-Licensed-to-Carry|Is Licensed to Carry]]
With small tweaks to the language and abilities, this could work for someone who wants to wield a wand, bow, or other ranged weapon. 

[[Sailed-Beneath-the-Jolly-Roger|Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger]]
With small tweaks to the language and abilities, this could work for someone who used to be a sailor or pirate.

#####  Fairy Tale Character Arcs
Character arcs are fantastic opportunities for players to deepen their roleplaying options, add to the narrative, and set goals that can intertwine with and strengthen a campaign or adventure. While character arcs aren’t a requirement, they work particularly well in fairy tale games, where individual goals and tasks are often at the forefront of what drives adventures.

Players can pick from any of the sample character arcs in the Cypher System Rulebook, make up their own (with the assistance and approval of the GM), or choose one of the new character arcs created specifically for the Heartwood setting.

##### Equipment
Most weapons that are powered by magic, such as wands, operate exactly like a regular weapon; they just do their damage using magic.

Equipment and weapons with unique magic abilities are typically considered to be cyphers or artifacts.

##### Currency
In most fairy tales, money isn’t precise. Someone might be poor or rich. They might find a bag of gold or a chest full of jewels. They might be the richest man in the town or have nothing but a tired old cow to their name. But typically what they don’t have is “one gold piece” or “thirty farthings” to their name. This means that whatever your fairy tale setting, you can think in general terms of money instead of keeping meticulous track of every penny, farthing, gold coin, or dollar.

To keep things easy, no matter what currency your characters use, think of money as being in simple amounts that scale up, such as a copper coin, a silver coin, and a gold coin. These could easily equate to the inexpensive, moderate, and expensive items on the equipment list. Items that are very expensive might be worth a bag of silver, while exorbitant items might be worth a bag of gold.

Additionally, if the PCs are completing a character arc, accomplishing a task, or doing some other type of action to receive a piece of equipment, you can use the price category to decide how complicated or difficult that task is. A moderately priced item likely requires completing a moderately difficult task, while an exorbitant item may require something that taxes the PCs and really puts their skills and dedication to the test.

##### Signature Items
In fairy tales, clothing, weapons, and other items that a character carries for a long time tend to be very personal and very important. They’re often unique and handcrafted,
they may have names or stories that go with them, and because characters tend to keep them for a long time, they may have undergone repairs or have markings that tell something about the character’s background.
##### Apparel and Armor
In most cases, characters start out by wearing any type of clothing they choose. Typically (unless the GM decides otherwise or unless it is designated as armor),
this clothing is purely for decorative and roleplaying purposes and offers no additional benefits.

However, clothing with additional benefits can be purchased, stolen, found, or earned by completing favors and accomplishing tasks. 
##### Optional Rule: I Have That!
>In fairy tales, characters often have exactly the right mundane piece of equipment
that they need to bypass a story-related obstacle hidden away in a pocket or a bag. Rather than having the PCs stock up on mundane items like marbles, rope, and breadcrumbs in town, use the I Have That! rule. This means players don’t have to keep exact track of their characters’ mundane equipment; instead, they spend an amount to get an unspecified 
> “Pocket Item” in that category. Then, when they’re out in the world and realize they could solve a problem with an item, they can just say, “I have that!” and pull it from their pocket. All Pocket Items are one-use only; after using them, the PC marks off one of their Pocket Items for the appropriate price category.
> 
>Most Pocket Items are inexpensive, but moderate and expensive Pocket Items exist, and are likely more useful than their less expensive counterparts.
>
>The GM has veto power over items that they don’t think you could have found or carried.
Using the I Have That! rule doesn’t preclude PCs from also purchasing these items directly. For example, if a character who sews wants to buy a thimble and an inexpensive Pocket Item, they can. However, they cannot later turn the thimble into a Pocket Item; it remains a thimble.

Alternatively, characters must take a class, learn a spell, or meet other magic requirements in order to operate the vehicle.

### Cyphers and Artifacts
Because magic and thus magic items are so prevalent in most fairy tales, cyphers in particular should be easy for characters to replenish. If you’re using subtle cyphers, you can choose how they arrive—on magic storms, perhaps, or in pockets of magic that exist throughout the world. Or maybe the magic is such that it just works, ensuring that cyphers show up whenever the characters need them.

Manifest cyphers should be readily available too—likely they can be found for cheap at a local market, stashed in hollow tree trunks or bird nests, or scattered about the forest floor. Manifest cyphers may also be integrated into people’s clothing or furnishings as unique adornments.

Artifacts are typically more valuable and less common. Therefore, player characters are less likely to encounter them at random and more likely to find them in the hands of NPCs, locked or hidden in chests, or for sale by high-end and specialized vendors. Acquiring an artifact should almost always require a sacrifice, trial, or difficult task.
#### Cypher Limits 
All characters have a maximum number of cyphers they can have at any one time, determined by their type. If a character ever attempts to carry more cyphers than their limit, the magic within the cyphers quickly begins to attract fey beings. Fey beings may react by stealing one or more cyphers, cursing the character, or even stealing the character away to a fey realm.

>Obviously, having a fey being steal a character away to their realm is a story-changer. If you’re using this as an option, figure out ahead of time what type of fey is attracted, what their realm is like, and how to play out the character’s disappearance and possible retrieval.

#### Cyphers
Cyphers are one-use abilities that characters gain over the course of play. They have powers that can heal, do damage, ease or hinder tasks, or produce interesting and unusual effects. In a fairy tale setting, they often appear as a simple object, such as a poisoned apple or a matchbook. They can also be something intangible, such as three wishes or a magic word. The shifting state of magic in fairy tales makes it easy to use both manifest and subtle cyphers in the same setting and campaign if you desire.
>In settings full of magic, cyphers should be both readily available and regularly used. If the PCs are hoarding or saving their cyphers, feel free to give them a reason to use them. And have a list of replacement cyphers ready so the players never have to go without.

Typically, something like a handful of magic beans or apple seeds
is considered a single cypher even though there are multiple items.
##### Cypher Forms
While characters can find or purchase many of these items in the world, only magic versions of the items are cyphers. Characters should easily be able to tell when an item is magic (and thus a cypher) and when it’s an ordinary item.

  #### Artifacts
Most artifacts in a Cypher System fairy tale setting are magical objects that have been either crafted via magic or later altered by or imbued with magic. There are a number of people and beings in fairy tale settings who are capable of creating artifacts by one or both of these methods. Additionally, some artifacts are products of magic or the setting itself. Thus, new artifacts are constantly entering the world, just waiting to be found and used by the characters.

##### Artifact Quirks
Magic runs through most items in a fairy tale world, but especially through artifacts. Magic is unknowable and mystifying, and thus something can—and often does—go wrong. While that may sometimes manifest as GM intrusions, it also shows up in artifacts as quirks. Every artifact has a quirk that sets it apart from mundane or lightly magical objects.
>Quirks typically do not make an artifact more powerful, but they can make it more interesting, difficult, useful, or just unique. Some quirks manifest during an item’s creation, while others might appear (or disappear) after a particular experience, usually one involving magic. Quirks may come and go without notice, but typically an artifact can have only one quirk at a time and is rarely without a quirk for long.

| 5   | Draws bees and occasionally drips honey.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 6   | Sometimes catches on fire when used; the blaze doesn’t do damage but it gives off heat and light.                                                                                                                 |

### Beasts and Beings
The following creatures and characters are provided to help populate your fairy tale game. 
Generally, the listings in this book work much the same way as they do for all Cypher System creature listings—the standard template includes the level, description, motive, environment, and so on.

The most important element of each creature is its level. You use the level to determine the target number a PC must reach to attack, defend against, or otherwise interact with a creature or NPC. In each entry, the difficulty number for the creature is listed in parentheses after its level.

A creature’s target number is usually also its health, which is the amount of damage it can sustain before it is dead or incapacitated. For easy reference, most entries list a creature’s health, and they always do so if it’s different from the normal amount for a creature of its level.

For more detailed information on how to use level, health, combat, and other elements, see the Understanding the Listings section in the Cypher System Rulebook.
Due to the dual and complex nature of many creatures in fairy tales, along with the large number of archetypes, there are several additional elements that you’ll want to take particular note of when using the creature listings.
>A creature’s health is always equal to its target number unless otherwise stated.

#### Suggested Additional Creatures for Use in Fairy Tale Settings

###### Suggested Magical Abilities for Animals

- **Bless** (use magic to give a character or object something beneficial, such as giving a weapon +1 damage for one round, or giving another character +1 Armor for one round)
- **Boon** (provide the character with a small beneficial object, such as a goose that lays a golden egg, a fish that finds a lost ring, and so on)
- **Conjure** (create a small useful item, such as a flask of water, a loaf of bread, or a candle)
- **Curse** (curse another creature to inflict damage, stun, daze, or otherwise affect them negatively for one or more rounds)
- **Glamour** (make themselves or someone else look different for a short period of time, or cast an illusion over a small area or for a short duration)
- **Healing** (heal themselves, another character, or a natural element of the world for 1–3 Pool points or health)
- **Information** (give directions to a town, the name of the man who lives in the nearby cottage, or the rumors about the area)
- **Invisibility** (turn themselves, another character, an object, or a place invisible for a short period of time)
- **Sage Advice** (see the future, offer suggestions on a difficult task, or guide a character’s actions)
- **Shapeshifting** (become a different type of animal or object, or cause someone else to become an animal or object for a short period of time)
- **Wish Granting** (grant a small wish, such as the ability to float for a short time in order to cross a river)

#### Talking Objects
If you have a talking object in your game, it has a level (just like creatures and regular objects), and every interaction with it is based on that level. Its level can be based on
its physical and mental complexity as well as its purpose. So something like a singing teapot might be level 2 with 2 Armor, and it can hurl its lid at a foe to inflict 2 points of damage. A complicated talking lock who guards a precious treasure might be level 5 or 6 and can cast a spell (inflicting 3 points of damage) on anyone who tries to pick it.
Some abilities in the game work only on objects, or only on creatures, or only on living things. A talking object might or might not be living, depending on its nature.

#### Of Bite and Claw (Creatures)

the Iron Giant, Edward Scissorhands, the Gingerbread Man, and the Tin Man.

##### Gingerbread Creatures

#### Of Earth and Stone (Creatures)
Creatures of the earth are those that seem to belong to the land in some unique and significant way. Perhaps they are made of the land and its offerings—tree beings, rock trolls, and so on—or perhaps they seem attached to the land in important ways, such as the way in which the minotaur is part of its maze or the way that dwarves have a unique connection to mountains.
Because the archetype of earth beings covers a broad range of creatures, there is no general entry for an earth being.

##### Dwarf

#### Fey (Creatures)

In fairy tales, the word fey covers a huge category of creatures, from faeries, brownies, and imps to gremlins, boggarts, and goblins. There are so many types of fey beings in
the world that it’s nearly impossible to categorize them as just one thing, or to list them all. They do have a few characteristics in common, however. They are typically sentient, humanoid in form, connected to nature in some way, and magical.

#### NPCs
The NPCs in the following section are general examples of nonmagical, mortal human characters that are commonly found in fairy tales.

From General to Specific: While the NPCs listed here are general types, such as crafter and robber, it’s easy to turn them into specific characters from common and well-known fairy tales. For example, with a little tweaking, you can turn a generic tailor into the tailor from The Brave Little Tailor. Just give the crafter NPC a banner that says “SEVEN WITH ONE BLOW” and embrace a jaunty, overconfident nature, and you have the titular character.
Health, Not Pools: Remember that NPCs don’t have stat Pools. Instead, they have a characteristic called health. When an NPC takes damage of any kind, the amount
is subtracted from their health. Unless described otherwise, an NPC’s health
is always equal to their target number. Some NPCs might have special reactions to or defenses against attacks that would normally deal Speed damage or Intellect damage, but unless the NPC’s description specifically explains this, assume that all damage is subtracted from the NPC’s health.

Naming Your NPCs: You might have noticed that in fairy tales, many characters —especially those of the lower or working classes—don’t have a name beyond their title, position, or profession (or sometimes their marriage status). “The Woodcutter,” “the Tailor,” “the Baker’s wife,” and so on. While you could follow suit and just call your NPC “the Woodcutter,” most player characters are going to ask that person their name. It’s likely to break immersion if you throw in a modern name, or if the NPC tries to explain that they don’t have one, they’re just called “the Woodcutter.” And if you call them all Jack, then no one (including you) will remember which one is which. Consider coming up with a list of names ahead of time so that you’re always ready to give players something to call a new walk-on character.
