## Skills  
  
  
Sometimes your character gains training in a specific skill or task. For example, your focus might mean that you’re trained in sneaking, in climbing and jumping, or in social interactions. Other times, your character can choose a skill to become trained in, and you can pick a skill that relates to any task you think you might face.  
  
### Example List  
>The Cypher System has no definitive list of skills. However, the following list offers ideas,   
>- Astronomy  
>- Balancing  
>- Biology  
>- Botany  
>- Carrying  
>- Climbing  
>- Computers  
>- Deceiving  
>- Disguise  
>- Escaping  
>- Geography  
>- Geology  
>- Healing  
>- History  
>- Identifying  
>- Initiative  
>- Intimidation  
>- Jumping  
>- Leatherworking  
>- Lockpicking  
>- Machinery  
>- Metalworking  
>- Perception  
>- Persuasion  
>- Philosophy  
>- Physics  
>- Pickpocketing  
>- Piloting  
>- Repairing  
>- Riding  
>- Smashing  
>- Sneaking  
>- Stealth  
>- Swimming  
>- Vehicle driving  
>- Woodworking  
  
You could choose a skill that incorporates more than one of these areas (interacting might include deceiving, intimidation, and persuasion) or that is a more specific version of one (hiding might be sneaking when you’re not moving). You could also make up more general professional skills, such as baker, sailor, or lumberjack. If you want to choose a skill that’s not on this list, it’s probably best to run it past the GM first, but in general, the most important thing is to choose skills that are appropriate to your character.  
  
Remember that if you gain a skill that you’re already trained in, you become specialized in that skill. Because skill descriptions can be nebulous, determining whether you’re trained or specialized might take some thinking. For example, if you’re trained in lying and later gain an ability that grants you skill with all social interactions, you become specialized in lying and trained in all other types of interactions. Being trained three times in a skill is no better than being trained twice (in other words, specialized is as good as it gets).  
  
Only skills gained through character type abilities or other rare instances allow you to become skilled with attack or defense tasks.  
  
If you gain a special ability through your type, your focus, or some other aspect of your character, you can choose it in place of a skill and become trained or specialized in that ability. For example, if you have a mind blast, when it’s time to choose a skill to be trained in, you can select your mind blast as your skill. That would ease the attack every time you used it. Each ability you have counts as a separate skill for this purpose. You can’t select “all mind powers” or “all spells” as one skill and become trained or specialized in such a broad category.

>fluency in a language is considered a skill. So if you want to speak French, that’s the same as being trained in biology or swimming.
