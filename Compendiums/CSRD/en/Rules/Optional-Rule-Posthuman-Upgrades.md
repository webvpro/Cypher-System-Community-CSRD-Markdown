## Optional Rule: Posthuman Upgrades

Posthuman upgrades are either available to everyone as the setting begins or opened up later during the campaign as a significant plot development. Note that many focus and type abilities might be considered to have come from the kind up bodily upgrades normally associated with posthuman transformation, especially high-tier abilities. Which is one way to go. On the other hand, you could provide actual upgrades, such as presented here, which actually increase the base power level of characters

### Introducing Upgrades To Your Setting  
You have a few options for adding posthuman upgrades to your setting. Characters might gain an initial upgrade for “free,” mechanically speaking. After that, you might decide that that’s enough and they’re done.  

Or, you could allow further upgrades, each requiring them to expend 4 XP and serving as an Other Option requirement for advancing their character. In this case, consider expanding the number of steps required for advancing a tier from four to five

>[!note]  
> Obtaining additional posthuman upgrades reflects characters accessing latent abilities already present inside them, or going back to whatever source granted the upgrades in the first place, if that’s something you want to allow.


> [!example] Immediate Posthuman Upgrades  
> As part of character creation, PCs are given the options presented hereafter because the setting demands it. Narrative options include (but are not limited to): 
> - PCs are part of a program designed to adapt them to being able to survive and thrive in conditions other than the 1 G, 1 atmosphere, oxygenated, Goldilocks environment of the Earth.  
> - PCs begin their career as super-soldiers to fight aliens or to serve as corporate spies.  
> - PCs serve as long-lived guardians to watch over a generation ship hurtling at slower-than-light speeds between the stars.  
> - PCs are children of a far-future civilization that routinely upgrades its citizens.  

> [!example] Delayed Posthuman Upgrades  
> Sometime after the players have a few sessions under their belt, present the options hereafter to the PCs because of a dramatic update to the plot. If one PC gains the option to upgrade, then all the PCs should have that same advantage. Narrative options include (but are not limited to):  
> - PCs, exploring a cache of ancient ultra or other fantastic tech, find a device that provides unexpected upgrades in the process of healing them from other injuries.  
> - PCs are kidnapped by aliens or conglomerate operatives, and upgraded—with some command-andcontrol circuits also installed—to serve some specific purpose.  
> - PCs learn a “new science,” allowing them to tap cosmic energies other creatures are unaware of.
### Posthuman Packages  

Posthuman “packages” that PCs might enjoy include the following. You should decide which are available, and which ones your PCs gain.

> [!example] Spaceborn
> You are not adversely affected by long-term microgravity or high-radiation conditions common in space. In addition, you can withstand high acceleration (up to 15 G) for about an hour without passing out, having a stroke, a heart attack, and so on (though longer periods of acceleration could still result in such outcomes). Add +1 to your Intellect Edge. Enabler. (PCs without the spaceborn posthuman upgrade probably have to rely on supplementation with adjuvants if they travel in space, such as space-fit serum)

> [!example] Jupiterborn  
> You can withstand high-gravity planets and high acceleration (up to 15 G) indefinitely. For periods of up to an hour, you can withstand double that. Add +1 to your Might Edge. Enabler. 


> [!example] Seaborn  
> You can breathe underwater in pressures of up to 100 atmospheres indefinitely, up to triple that for about an hour. You have an asset to all tasks performed in water. Add +1 to your Speed Edge. Enabler. 

> [!example] Expanded Consciousness
> Only one of your brain hemispheres sleeps at a time, so you are always awake and aware. In addition, you have a magnetoreception sixth sense that allows you to “see” into objects and through doors up to a short distance. Your initiative and perception tasks are eased. You can forge a connection with electronic equipment you touch, allowing you to attempt to communicate, analyze, or even hack the device. Enabler. 

> [!example] Synthetic Body   
> You have left biology behind and uploaded yourself into a biomechanical form known as a synth. You enjoy the benefits of the spaceborn package and expanded consciousness package, and one posthuman power shift. Enabler.

### Posthuman Power Shifts  
 A character may also gain posthuman abilities by way of [[power shifts]], as described in the Cypher System Rulebook.  
 
 Under this rule, posthuman characters begin with two power shifts. They can “unlock” one more each time they expend 4 XP toward advancing their character. Power shifts are like permanent levels of Effort that are always active. They don’t count toward a character’s maximum Effort use (nor do they count as skills or assets). They simply ease tasks that fall into specific categories, which include (but are not necessarily limited to):  
> **Accuracy:** All attack rolls All attack rolls 

>**Dexterity:** Movement, acrobatics, initiative, and Speed defense 

>**Healing:** One extra recovery roll per shift (each one action, all coming before other normal recovery rolls)  

>**Power:** Use of a specific power, including damage (3 additional points per shift) but not attack rolls 

> **Resilience:** Might defense rolls and Armor (+1 per shift) 

>**Single Attack:** Attack rolls and damage (3 additional points per shift) 

>**Strength:** All tasks involving strength, including jumping and dealing damage in melee or thrown attacks (3 additional points of damage per shift) but not attack rolls 

>[!note]  
>Each shift eases the task (except for shifts that affect damage or Armor, as specified in the list above). Applying two shifts eases the task by two steps, and applying three shifts eases the task by three steps. A character assigns their five power shifts as desired, but most characters should not be allowed to assign more than three to any one category. Once the shifts are assigned, they should not change.
