# Superhero Rules Module
Like horror, the superhero genre is really a subset of the modern genre with extensive special considerations. In many ways, it might appear that the Cypher System is a strange fit for superheroes. But if you think about it, with foci like Bears a Halo of Fire and Wears a Sheen of Ice, the Cypher System makes all genres a little bit “superhero-ish.” Character sentences might look like the following:
>- Firebrand is a Brash energy projector (Adept) who Bears a Halo of Fire.
>- King Brick is a Tough Warrior who Performs Feats of Strength.
>- Dimensionar is a Mystical warlock (Adept) who Exists Partially Out of Phase.
>- Dark Ronin is a Mysterious crimefighter (Explorer) who Solves Mysteries.
>- Speedburst is a Fast crimefighter (Explorer) who Moves Like the Wind.
>- And so on.

## Additional Superhero Equipment
Suggested additional equipment is the same as in a modern setting. Keep in mind, however, that for many heroes, “equipment” can be superfluous. Where do you stash the flashlight and rope when all you’re wearing is spandex tights?
## Optional Rule: Power Shifts
Superheroes can do things that other people cannot. They throw cars, blast through brick walls, leap onto speeding trains, and cobble together interdimensional gateways in a few hours. It’s tempting to say that such characters are stronger, faster, or smarter, so they should have higher Might, Speed, or Intellect Pools. However, simply bumping up stat Pools or Edge doesn’t fully represent this dramatic increase in power. Instead, consider using an optional rule called power shifts.

Under this rule, all superhero characters get five power shifts. Power shifts are like permanent levels of Effort that are always active. They don’t count toward a character’s maximum Effort use (nor do they count as skills or assets). They simply ease tasks that fall into specific categories, which include (but are not necessarily limited to) the following.

### Accuracy
>All attack rolls
### Dexterity
>Movement, acrobatics, initiative, and Speed defense
### Flight
>The character can fly a short distance each round; each additional shift increases this speed (whether the flight comes from a power shift or a character ability) by one range category (long for two shifts, very long for three shifts).
### Healing
>One extra recovery roll per shift (each one action, all coming before other normal recovery rolls)
### Intelligence
>Intellect defense rolls and all knowledge, science, and crafting tasks
### Power
>Use of a specific power, including damage (3 additional points per shift) but not attack rolls
### Prodigy
>Give up a lower-tier ability to get a higher-tier ability
### Resilience
>Might defense rolls and Armor (+1 per shift)
### Savant
>Two specific skills (other than attacks, defenses, or a special ability), such as history, perception, or persuasion.
### Single Attack
>Attack rolls and damage (3 additional points per shift)
### Strength
>All tasks involving strength, including jumping and dealing damage in melee or thrown attacks (3 additional points of damage per shift) but not attack rolls

Each shift eases the task (except for shifts that affect damage or Armor, as specified in the list above). Applying 2 shifts eases the task by two steps, and applying 3 shifts eases the task by three steps.

A character assigns their five power shifts as desired, but most characters should not be allowed to assign more than three to any one category. Once the shifts are assigned, they should not change.

For example, a superstrong character might put three of their shifts into strength and the other two into resilience. Whenever they lift something heavy, smash through a wall, or throw an object, they ease the task by three steps before applying Effort, skill, or assets. Thus, all difficulties from 0 to 3 are routine for them. They smash through level 3 doors as if they don’t exist. As another example, a masked vigilante character with a utility belt full of gadgets and great acrobatic skills might put two shifts in dexterity, one in accuracy, one in intelligence, and one in healing. They’re not actually superpowered, just tough and well trained.

Some GMs will want to allow PCs to increase their power shifts. Having a character spend 10 XP to do so would probably be appropriate. Other GMs will want to run superhero games with PCs of greater or lesser power (cosmic-level heroes or street-level heroes, perhaps). In such cases, more or fewer power shifts should be granted to the PCs at the game’s start.


### Superpowered NPCs and Power Shifts
NPC superheroes and villains get power shifts, too. Most of the time, this adds to their level. For example, Blast Star is a level 5 fiery villain who has three power shifts. When she blasts through a level 7 iron security door, she does so easily because in this circumstance, she’s actually level 8.

Sometimes, NPC power shifts make things harder for the PCs. For example, Fleetfoot the level 4 speedster puts all three of her shifts in dexterity. When she runs past a character who tries to grab her, the difficulty to do so is increased by three steps to 7.
Typical NPC supers get three power shifts. Exceptional ones usually have five.

## Really Impossible Tasks
In superhero games, due to conventions of the genre, difficulty caps at 15 instead of 10. Difficulty 10 is labeled “impossible,” but that label is for regular folks. For superpowered characters, “impossible” means something different, thanks to power shifts.

Think of each difficulty above 10 as being one more step beyond impossible. Although a GM in another genre would say there’s no chance that a character could leap 100 feet (30 m) from one rooftop to another, in a superhero game, that might just be difficulty 11. Picking up a city bus isn’t something normal characters could do, but for a strong superhero, it might be difficulty 12.

In theory, NPCs in such a game can go up to level 15 as well. Levels above 10 represent opponents that only a superhero would consider taking on: a robot that’s 1,000 feet (300 m) tall (level 11); Galashal, Empress of Twelve Dimensions (level 14); or a space monster the size of the moon (level 15).

## Superhero Artifacts
Supervillains build doomsday devices. Ancient artifacts present a threat to all humanity if in the wrong hands. Weird machines from alien dimensions offer solutions to unsolvable problems. Artifacts are an important part of superhero stories. A few examples are below.

## Really Impossible Tasks
The Cypher System Rulebook gives a few examples of how, in the superhero genre, having power shifts means that a difficulty 10 task is not impossible. Superheroes deal with planetary threats like giant robots, multidimensional sorcerers, and world-sized monsters, and for this sort of campaign, difficulties up to 15 are possible. This section presents more details and examples of tasks, threats, and creatures of difficulty 11 to 15.
### Feats of Strength
Use the following table to estimate the difficulty of various incredible feats of physical strength.

| Difficulty	Lifting Task                                              |                    |                     |                      |                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 4	Lift a 150-pound (68 kg) object                                    |                    |                     |                      |                        |
| 9	Lift a 400-pound (180 kg) object                                   |                    |                     |                      |                        |
| 10	Lift a 1-ton (1 tonne) car or traffic copter                      |                    |                     |                      |                        |
| 11	Lift a 5-ton (4.5 tonne) ambulance                                | private jet        | elephant            | or Tyrannosaurus rex |                        |
| 12	Lift a 10-ton (9 tonne) school bus                                | combat helicopter  | triceratops         | or 5-foot boulder    |                        |
| 13	Lift a 20-ton (18 tonne) fire truck                               | mobile home        | fighter jet         | Apatosaurus          | or light military tank |
| 14	Lift a 40-ton (36 tonne) humpback whale or loaded tractor-trailer |                    |                     |                      |                        |
| 15	Lift an 80-ton (72 tonne) space shuttle                           | single-story house | passenger train car | or military tank     |                        |

| Task Circumstances                                               | Difficulty |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Lifting the object as high as the character can reach            | +0         |
| Lifting the object only partway off the ground                   | -1         |
| Asset (lever, jack, etc.)                                        | -1 or -2   |
| Help from another character (asset)                              | -1 or -2   |
| Large character (double human size)                              | -1*        |
| Carrying an object an immediate distance                         | +0         |
| Carrying an object a short distance                              | +1         |
| Pushing or pulling (not lifting) an object an immediate distance | -1         |
| Pushing or pulling (not lifting) an object a short distance      | +0         |
| Pushed or pulled object can roll or slide very easily            | -1         |
| Pushed or pulled object is buoyant and moving through water      | -1         |

* Each additional doubling of the character’s size eases the task by another step.
Some character abilities are able to move heavy things, often more easily than brute physical strength can. If a superhero wants to push the limits of what those abilities can do, the GM can compare the baseline effects of those abilities to the Feats of Strength table to determine the comparable difficulty of the task, and modify the character’s roll to succeed.
### Feats of Speed
A character can move a short distance (50 feet [15 m]) as their entire action as a routine task (difficulty 0, no roll needed). This is basically a jog or a hustle, faster than a walk
but not an all-out run. A character can try to run a long distance (100 feet [30 m]) as their entire action, but they must succeed at a difficulty 4 Speed task to complete the movement; failure means they trip, stumble, slip, or fall down at some point during the move and stop.

Of course, superheroes aren’t normal people—they’re exceptional, and some can run as fast as Olympic athletes, or much faster. For a character trying to run more than a long distance as their entire action, use the following table to determine the difficulty for the task. Failing this roll is just like failing the basic running roll described above.

| Difficulty | Running Distance   | Notes                                   |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 6          | 200 feet (60 m)    | 19 mph (30 kph)                         |
| 8          | 250 feet (76 m)    | 24 mph (39 kph); bear, Olympic sprinter |
| 9          | 340 feet (104 m)   | 33 mph (53 kph); cat, coyote, greyhound |
| 10         | 400 feet (120 m)   | 49 mph (79 kph); horse, tiger           |
| 11         | 700 feet (210 m)   | 68 mph (110 kph); cheetah               |
| 12         | 1,400 feet (430 m) | 136 mph (220 kph)                       |
| 13         | 2,800 feet (850 m) | 273 mph (440 kph)                       |
| 14         | 1 mile (1.5 km)    | 545 mph (880 kph); Boeing 747           |
| 15         | 2 miles (3 km)     | 1,600 mph (2,575 kph); Mach 2           |

### Tremendous Leaps
Some—but not all—strong superheroes can easily leap dozens or hundreds of feet, well beyond what’s possible with the jumping rules (running a short distance and jumping 30 feet [9 m] is a difficulty 10 task). Characters who want to jump huge distances like that should take the Amazing Leap ability, allowing them to jump a long distance or more.
All characters with at least one power shift in strength get the benefit of a free level of Effort for each strength shift. This effectively increases their standing jump distance by 1 foot (30 cm) per shift and their running jump distance by 2 feet (60 cm) per shift, which is impressive compared to a normal person, but not phenomenal.

To make superhero character jumps a bit more exciting, the GM can implement an optional rule in which strength shifts count double for free levels of Effort when jumping. For example, a character with five strength shifts would get ten free levels of Effort on jump tasks instead of five. This allows them to do a 15-foot (4.5 m) standing jump as a difficulty 1 task (base difficulty 11, eased by 5 × 2 steps) and a 40-foot (12 m) running jump as a difficulty 5 task (base difficulty 15, eased by 5 × 2 steps), which seems more appropriate for a character strong enough to lift a car over their head.

### Powerful Creatures
Superheroes don’t just stop bank robbers and fight supervillains—sometimes they face giant robots, alien space monsters, or so-called gods. GMs can use the following examples to estimate the level and challenges for such threats.

| Level | Example                                                                      |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 9     | Demigod                                                                      |
| 10    | Kaiju 300 feet (90 m) tall                                                   |
| 11    | Robot 1,000 feet (300 m) tall                                                |
| 12    | Vampire blood god                                                            |
| 13    | Legendary monster*                                                           |
| 14    | Archangel, demon prince, typical god or goddess**, multidimensional sorcerer |
| 15    | Moon-sized space monster, pantheon leader***                                 |

\* A primordial monster (such as Echidna or Typhon) or a powerful creature associated with the end of the world (such as Jörmungandr or Fenris).

\** A powerful, perhaps immortal entity (such as Ares or Loki) that has been worshipped or feared as a god by humans or similar creatures.

\*** A god or goddess (such as Odin or Zeus) who is the ruler of a group of deities.

### Modifying High-tech Devices
It’s common for technically savvy superheroes to fiddle with machines to make them work better or do something different. Sometimes the object in question is their own gear, but it’s just as likely to be something they took from a defeated supervillain or found on an alien spaceship.

A character who expects to modify many devices should consider learning abilities such as Innovator, Jury-Rig, Modify Artifact Power, Modify Device, and Quick Work. A character who only wants to dabble in this sort of activity can do so, but it takes longer and is less efficient.

Small modifications are things like changing a device’s target, range, or duration. “Small” is subjective and up to the GM, but generally, it means adding another target (although for some high-level devices, adding a target isn’t a small change), increasing the range by one step (immediate to short, short to long, long to very long), or increasing the duration by one step (one minute to one hour, one hour to ten hours). The task difficulty for making a small modification is generally equal to the device’s level minus 1, which also determines how much time it takes to complete the modifications. 

Big changes are modifying a laser rifle to shoot cold or electricity, turning a communication device into a telepathic shield, or turning a jetpack into a force field device. These modifications are like repairs; they use the device’s level for the difficulty and creation time, but take half as long as the time listed. 

A character modifying their own device eases the task. This applies whether the character built the device themselves or they’ve been repairing and tinkering with it long enough that they fully understand its workings.

Regardless of whether the change is big or small, failing the modification task means the character wastes the full amount of time spent attempting the modification, and uses up materials equal to the device’s level minus 2, but they can try again. If they fail with a roll of a natural 1, it’s likely that the free GM intrusion means the device is ruined (but perhaps could be salvaged for materials).
>[!example] Modification GM intrusions
>The device gains a high depletion rate, needs to be recharged after each use, or develops a side effect such as overheating (inflicting damage to the user) or creating a thunderous noise.

Modifying a device is similar to using a power stunt to alter a character ability. If a character wants to make a permanent change to one of their technology-based abilities, the GM should treat that more like a permanent power stunt—costing XP—than a modification.

Modifying the appearance of an item is just a cosmetic change and should take only a few hours at most for a typical handheld or worn item like a weapon, helmet, or boots. Changing the appearance of a spacesuit or full-body mechanized armor might take eight to twenty hours of work, depending on the extent of the changes.
#### Faster Crafting in a High-tech Setting
In some superhero campaigns, crafting technology is so advanced that objects are designed virtually, with holograms, or with a mind-machine interface, and they are constructed by advanced 3D printers or clouds of nanobots. Under these conditions, the GM should ease the assessed difficulty to determine the crafting time by three or four steps, with the crafter needing to be present for only about the first quarter of that time and the “helpers” taking care of the rest.
CYPHERS AND ARTIFACTS
In a superhero campaign, there’s a fine line between cyphers (one-use items or abilities awarded by the GM), artifacts, character abilities (which may cost Pool points to use), and other equipment (which has none of those criteria). The GM should keep in mind that it’s good from a story point of view to let characters have equipment they need to deal more effectively with foes that might otherwise be too potent.
### Special Equipment
Sometimes a group of superheroes needs special equipment so they can participate in an encounter or advance the story. For example, characters who must get to an underwater base will need air tanks or a water-breathing device, and those going on a short trip into space will need a vehicle and spacesuits. This sort of item doesn’t have to be a cypher (which counts against a character’s cypher limit) or an artifact (which has a depletion chance)—it can just be equipment. If a player suggests a suitable piece of equipment they can buy (such as scuba gear), or a gadgeteer or inventor character offers to build something to do the job, the GM should let them do it and handwave most of the details because they’re being creative and overcoming obstacles to move the story forward. In other words, don’t assume that every piece of weird equipment needs to be a cypher or artifact; things that allow the adventure to happen shouldn’t cost the characters much, or maybe not anything at all. And if the players take too much advantage of this leeway, the GM always has the option to use an intrusion to complicate an encounter.
### Power Boost Cyphers
This section introduces two new power boost cyphers, and consolidates the two efficacy boost cyphers in the Cypher System Rulebook into one cypher with variable effects based on cypher level.

| 01-10 | Area boost     |

| 11-20 | [[Burst-Boost\|Burst Boost]]    |
| 21-30 | [[Damage-Boost\|Damage Boost]]   |
