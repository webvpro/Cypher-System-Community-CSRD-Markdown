## Character Descriptor, Type, And Focus

To create your character, you build a simple statement that describes them. The statement takes this form: “I am a \[fill in an adjective here] \[fill in a noun here] who \[fill in a verb here].” 

**Thus:** “I am an adjective noun who verbs.” For example, you might say, “I am a [[Rugged|Rugged]] [[Warrior|Warrior]] who [[Controls-Beasts|Controls Beasts]]” or “I am a [[Charming|Charming]] [[Explorer|Explorer]] who [[Focuses-Mind-over-Matter|Focuses Mind over Matter]].”

In this sentence, 
>the adjective is called your descriptor.

>The noun is your character type.

>The verb is called your focus.

Even though character type is in the middle of the sentence, that’s where we’ll start this discussion. (Just as in a sentence, the noun provides the foundation.)

>Your character [[Type-x|type]] is the core of your character. In some roleplaying games, it might be called your character class. Your type helps determine your character’s place in the world and relationship with other people in the setting. It’s the noun of the sentence “I am an adjective noun who verbs.”

>You can choose from four character types: [[Warrior|Warriors]], [[Adept|Adepts]],  [[Explorer|Explorers]], and [[Speaker|Speakers]].

>Your [[Descriptor|descriptor]] defines your character—it colors everything you do. Your descriptor places your character in the situation (the first adventure, which starts the campaign) and helps provide motivation. It’s the adjective of the sentence “I am an adjective noun who verbs.”

>Unless your GM says otherwise, you can choose from any of the character descriptors.

> [[Focus]] is what your character does best. Focus gives your character specificity and provides interesting new abilities that might come in handy. Your focus also helps you understand how you relate with the other player characters in your group. It’s the verb of the sentence 
>“I am an adjective noun who verbs.”
>There are many character foci. The ones you choose from will probably depend on the setting and genre of your game.

>You can use the Flavors chapter to slightly modify character types to customize them for different genres.
