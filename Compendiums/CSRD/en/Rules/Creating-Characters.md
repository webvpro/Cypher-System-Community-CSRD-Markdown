## Creating Your Character

>[tip] Form Vs. Function
>In a fairy tale game, the PCs might consist of a talking fox, an ogre, a fairy, and a human the size of your thumb. And that’s perfectly fine. Build your character sentence in a way that plays to your character’s strengths and weaknesses, and the rest can be handled through story and narrative. Playing a talking bear, a gingerbread man, or a changeling will likely affect your character’s appearance, their outlook on life, and their backstory, but it doesn’t necessarily affect their abilities, skills, and Pools beyond what you choose during character creation.
>
>Because the form that you choose doesn’t typically offer you something in addition to your Cypher System stats—being small, for example, does not inherently mean you’re stealthy—you’ll want to choose your stats to emphasize the bit of your character that you want to play.


This section explains how to create characters to play in a Cypher System game. This involves a series of decisions that will shape your character, so the more you understand what kind of character you want to play, the easier character creation will be. The process involves understanding the values of three game statistics and choosing three aspects that determine your character’s capabilities.

### Pool, Edge, Effort  
Each of the three stats has two components: Pool and Edge. Your Pool represents your raw, innate ability, and your Edge represents knowing how to use what you have. A third element ties into this concept: Effort. When your character really needs to accomplish a task, you apply Effort.  
>[!info] 
>Your stat Pools, as well as your Effort and Edge, are determined by the character type, descriptor, and focus that you choose. Within those guidelines, however, you have a lot of flexibility in how you develop your character.
