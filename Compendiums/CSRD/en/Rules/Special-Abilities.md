## Special Abilities

Character [[Type-x|type]] and [[Focus|foci]]  grant PCs special abilities at each new tier. Using these abilities usually costs points from your stat [[Pool|Pools]]; the cost is listed in parentheses after the ability name. Your [[Edge]] in the appropriate stat can reduce the cost of the ability, but remember that you can apply [[Edge]] only once per action. For example, let’s say an [[Adept]] with an Intellect Edge of 2 wants to use their [[Onslaught|Onslaught]] ability to create a bolt of force, which costs 1 Intellect point. They also want to increase the damage from the attack by using a level of Effort, which costs 3 Intellect points. The total cost for their action is 2 points from their Intellect Pool.
>[!note] 
>1 point for the bolt of force, plus 3 points for using Effort, minus 2 points from their Edge.

Sometimes the point cost for an ability has a + sign after the number. For example, the cost might be given as “2+ Intellect points.” That means you can spend more points or more levels of Effort to improve the ability further, as explained in the ability description.

Many special abilities grant a character the option to perform an action that they couldn’t normally do, such as projecting rays of cold or attacking multiple foes at once. Using one of these abilities is an action unto itself, and the end of the ability’s description says “Action” to remind you. It also might provide more information about when or how you perform the action.

Some special abilities allow you to perform a familiar action one that you can already do in a different way. For example, an ability might let you wear heavy armor, reduce the difficulty of Speed defense rolls, or add 2 points of fire damage to your weapon damage. These abilities are called enablers. Using one of these abilities is not considered an action. Enablers either function constantly (such as being able to wear heavy armor, which isn’t an action) or happen as part of another action (such as adding fire damage to your weapon damage, which happens as part of your attack action). If a special ability is an enabler, the end of the ability’s description says “Enabler” to remind you.

Some abilities specify a duration, but you can always end one of your own abilities anytime you wish.
>Because the Cypher System covers so many genres, not all of the descriptors, types, and foci might be available for players. The GM will decide what’s available in their particular game and whether anything is modified, and they’ll let the players know.
