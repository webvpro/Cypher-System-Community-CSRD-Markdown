##  Extended Vehicular Combat (Spacecraft Combat)  
When vehicular combat occurs—which happens whenever the PCs are completely enclosed in a vehicle so that it’s not really the characters fighting, but the vehicles— start with the vehicular combat rules described in the Cypher System Rulebook. 
However, if you’d like to provide the PCs with more options designed especially for spacecraft combat, use these optional rules instead, which include a “redline maneuver” system for trying extremely risky spacecraft maneuvers, bridge combat options, and more. The base vehicular combat rules have been integrated into these extended rules, so you don’t need to continually cross-reference them to understand how it all works.
In extended vehicular combat, PCs on a spacecraft take actions on their turn, just like in a standard Cypher System combat encounter. Use standard initiative rules to determine when PCs take their actions, and when enemy spacecraft take theirs. Characters will be crewing specific spacecraft system stations described under Bridge Combat, and thus could attempt a piloting maneuver, to fire the ship weapons, to scan the enemy craft for weaknesses, or to attempt some similar spacecraft operation task on their turn. Alternatively, they might be somewhere else on the ship attempting repairs, fighting off boarders, attempting to open communications in order to negotiate, or taking some other action. 

For their part, enemy spacecraft are likely to fire on the same systems aboard a PCs’ spacecraft as the ones the PCs are firing on (weapons, defenses, engines, or even a kill shot). The PC pilot rolls one or more defense rolls. The enemy spacecraft faces the same modifications the PCs face when targeting a particular system (as described hereafter), except those modifications ease or hinder the PC making the defense roll, since NPC craft never roll themselves. And, if an enemy ship manages to disable a system on the PCs’ ship on an attack, PCs can attempt repair tasks to get those systems back online on their turns. 
The main difference between spacecraft combat and regular combat is that the difficulty of tasks that the PCs attempt in relation to the enemy craft varies a lot more than in regular combat. In normal combat, a task difficulty is usually equal to the foe’s level. But in spacecraft combat, a task difficulty is equal to a modified task difficulty (beginning with the spacecraft’s level, but moving on from there, as noted hereafter). The modified difficulty always applies to anything characters attempt in regard to the enemy spacecraft, whether a PC fires at an enemy ship, dodges return fire, attempts to scan the enemy spacecraft, attempts to repair damage caused by the enemy spacecraft, and so on.

It’s actually similar to a normal task. For example, when a PC scans a robot, the task difficulty is usually the robot’s level, but not always. Sometimes the robot’s effective level is modified because of intrinsic skills or systems the robot possesses, or because of something it does making it harder (or easier) for it to be scanned. In the case of spacecraft combat, modification is pretty much a given, and is even more variable. So variable, in fact, that a space combat status tracker has been provided. to turn potentially confusing conflicts into something as easy as looking at a marker to know what the difficulty for a particular task is.
The modifiers that apply, even before PCs attempt a specific combat task noted under Bridge Combat, are as follows.

>[!example] Base Combat Task Modifiers  
>The following modifiers change the effective level of the enemy of the spacecraft for a given task by hindering or easing a PC’s roll. Track each change in effective level on the space combat status tracker

>[!example] Spacecraft Level Difference  
>Compare the levels of the spacecraft involved in the conflict. If the PCs’ vehicle has the higher level, the difference in levels becomes a reduction in the difficulty of attack and defense rolls PCs might make. If the PCs’ vehicle has the lower level, the difference is an increase in difficulty by the same amount. If the levels are the same, there is no modification. 

>[!example] Mismatched Tech Rating  
>It’s possible that vehicles from different tech ratings will fight each other at some point, or become caught up in a larger multi-vehicle fight. When they do, each step difference in tech rating between two opposed vehicles increases the effective level of the higher-rated vehicle by two steps.

>[!example] Vehicle Coordination 
>If two vehicles coordinate their attack against an enemy vehicle, the attack is eased. If three or more vehicles coordinate, the attack is eased by two steps. 

>[!example] Superior Ship Systems  
>Some vehicles have superior weapons or defenses, as noted in the specific vehicle listing in chapter 8. If a vehicle has a superior system, treat that vehicle as if one level higher than its actual level when figuring attacks or evasion tasks if that specific system is involved.

>[!example] Redline Maneuver  
>When someone with access to spacecraft controls attempts a particularly audacious and risky maneuver, it’s a “redline” maneuver. Essentially, declaring a redline maneuver eases one task a PC attempts in a spacecraft under duress, but comes with a concomitant risk. 
>
>To make a redline maneuver, a character spends 1 XP as a free action. In doing so, they unlock the option for all the PCs to attempt to redline for rest of the combat. To redline, a PC describes the dangerous thing they want to attempt, then takes that action. Mechanically, the PC eases the particular task they are attempting (which might just be to fire at the enemy craft’s weapons), but increases the GM intrusion range by two points.  
>A character who redlines could opt to increase their gamble by easing a task by two steps or even more; however, each step increases the GM intrusion range by another two points that round.  
>
>Redline maneuvers are also available in desperate non-combat situations aboard a spacecraft. For example, Tammie’s ship is caught in a decaying orbit over Venus, and the ship doesn’t have enough power left to break out. She tells the GM that she’s going to try an extremely risky maneuver that involves igniting ALL the remaining power at once, hoping that the explosive thrust will succeed in blowing the craft into a higher orbit. Because things are desperate, she commits to easing the task by two steps after paying 1 XP. This easing (plus any skill, application of Effort, and so on) gives her a pretty decent chance of succeeding, except the GM intrusion range is now 1–5.  
>
>If a GM intrusion is triggered, something goes wrong. Remember that success might still be possible if the roll was high enough, but still falls within the increased GM intrusion range.  
>
>If you’re looking for inspiration for appropriate GM intrusions when a redlining PC triggers one, refer to suggested GM intrusions presented under Bridge Combat hereafter, each associated with a particular ship system that a character is probably crewing.  
>
>After any round where a redline maneuver was attempted, the GM intrusion range returns to normal (1 on a 1d20) as the next round beings.  
> 
>> [!info] Multiple Redline Maneuvers  
>> Only one PC needs to spend 1 XP to unlock redline maneuvers for themselves and for any other PCs aboard the same spacecraft for the duration of a single encounter. Multiple redline attempts during the same round by two or more PCs additively increase the GM intrusion range for that round. So, a PC attempting to redline who takes their turn after previous redline attempts that round faces a GM intrusion range that’s already inflated, and which will inflate more when they redline. (PCs who do not redline during a particular round don’t have to worry about the increasing GM intrusion range for their action.)  
> 
> Thus, while PCs do not need to pre-announce their intention to redline at the beginning of each round, coordinating wouldn’t be a bad idea. Whichever PC redlines last in a round where redline maneuvers were already attempted could face a fairly significant GM intrusion range.
> 
> If Void Rules are also being used and have triggered, redline maneuvers are even more dangerous.

>[!example] The Superiority Of A Well-crewed Spacecraft  
>A spacecraft with some or all of the PCs crewing different systems stations will be more capable than a regular spacecraft in combat. Which means that an enemy spacecraft that might prove challenging based on its level might actually be fairly easily handled by PCs who fully understand their options.  
>
>But be careful, because even competent PCs should fear squadrons of enemy ships, and military craft with several weapon systems. Even a single level difference is magnified, so make sure not to capriciously throw spacecraft at the PCs that are 2 levels higher than their own

>[!example] Bridge Combat
>If several PCs are aboard the same spacecraft, give them the following option: ask each PC to crew one of the ship system stations, including weapons (of which there could be more than one system, requiring more than one PC to crew them all), piloting, and science and engineering (which could be divided into two stations with similar functionality). A spacecraft generally has a number of system stations equal to its level. PCs on spacecraft that are lower level must flip between system controls as part of another action, using two stations or even just one station for the whole ship. Even if a PC flips a station (reconfigures, as engineers like to say), only a single PC can crew a station (and take an action using it) each round.  
>
> >[!note] 
> > When crewing their stations, PCs have several station-specific options available to them. What they do can bears on how the encounter plays out on a round-to-round basis, similar to regular combat. Specific options are provided for each station, but characters are free to attempt other actions they can think of.  
> 
>The following ship systems might be found on larger spacecraft with room for more than a single pilot.
> >[!note] Shipmind System Control  
> >Some ships with integrated AIs (shipminds) can control a particular system autonomously, without a PC. When it acts in this fashion, it can only take a single action each round, which means it could attack and move, but not also attempt a complicated engineering or defensive maneuver. A shipmind acts at a level equal to the overall spacecraft. In addition, shipmind actions against an enemy spacecraft are assessed with the same modifiers for targeting as a PC crewing the station.
>
> >[!example] Weapons
> > A spacecraft may have more than one weapon system. Each individual weapon system has its own station, which can be crewed by a separate PC. Spacecraft systems are considered heavy weapons (which means some characters may be practiced in their use, though others may have an inability). A spacecraft can potentially make as many attacks each round as weapon systems it possesses, if each station is crewed.

> >[!example] Piloting
> > Many spacecraft have only a single system and dedicated station for piloting and navigation, suitable for a single PC to crew, though a larger craft could split those duties. A PC piloting a ship during combat can attempt any number of piloting tasks, as well as any other type of flying that they deem necessary. While not in combat, the PC crewing this station pilots the ship from place to place in space.

> > Refer to [[PC-Piloting-System-Options|PC Piloting System Options]]. If the PC triggers a GM intrusion, the following table provides options to choose from.  
> > 
> > A successful piloting defense task is not always a miss: A failed enemy attack doesn’t always mean it misses a character’s craft. The PC’s spacecraft might rock and reel from the hit, but the bulk of the damage was absorbed by the hull or shields, so there’s no significant damage.

> >[!example] Science And Engineering 
> > A spacecraft may have more than one science and engineering system. Each science and engineering system has a station, each of which can be crewed by a separate PC. A spacecraft can potentially attempt as many science and engineering tasks each round as stations systems it possesses, if each one is crewed.

> >[!example] Optional: Command  
> >Ships with a captain may have a Command station, possibly a captain’s chair, though the captain might just crew one of the other stations. Sometimes those with captain’s privileges also have the Captain’s Calm special ability. Normally, a captain commanding someone else to do something can’t redline; it would be up to the person who received the command whether to try to redline or not, and to face any GM intrusion consequences.

> >[!note] Bridge Combat At The Table
> >Running a combat using these extended rules is straightforward. 
> > >[!tip] Know your stuff  
> > >First, familiarize yourself with the material. Assign characters a station: Next, if you have some time to prepare, copy the two-page spread containing the various PC system options, and give one to each player. Tell them to figure out what stations they are crewing, based on the number of systems their ship has (usually no more systems than the level of the ship). You will probably also have to explain the basics.  
> >
> > >[!tip] Deploy space combat status tracker  
> > >Also make a copy of the one-page space combat status tracker and set it on the table so everyone can see. It’ll make a huge difference in how your space combat plays out. The status tracker allows you (and the players) to easily mark the difficulty of current space combat task a PC is attempting, without having to hold all the easing and hindering in your heads, or having to write them out each time. 
> > 
> > >[!tip] Space Combat Status Tracker Instructions  
> > >Using dice (or similar objects) as markers, track the difficulty of the current task that a PC is attempting, as well as the GM intrusion range for that round if any character is attempting to redline. Place the marker in the column appropriate to the kind of task being attempted (attack, defense, or other) at the starting difficulty level. If the PCs face more than one enemy spacecraft, use different colored dice to represent different ships, or separate copies of this status tracker for each additional enemy spacecraft.  
> > >At the end of each full round, reset all the markers on the tracker to their base state, unless some effect causes a modification that lasts longer than a round. Be sure to reset the GM intrusion marker, too.
> >
> > >[!tip] Roll initiative  
> > >Begin the combat, with the enemy spacecraft of your choice taking on the PCs’ ship. Decide whether the enemy spacecraft are already in weapon range (it’s your call, we’re not tracking that here), and if not, how soon they will be close enough to begin attacking, and let the combat flow.

>[!note]  Vehicles Fighting Creatures 
> > **Spacecraft vs. Colossal Creatures:**  
> > If a creature is as capable as a spacecraft, treat it that way when it comes to vehicular combat. Instead of adjusting for mismatched tech rating, treat the creature’s effective level as if three levels less than its actual level. Extrapolate “weapon systems” to the creature’s attack methods, defenses to its weird organic plating, and so on. Killing such a creature means taking out its “power core or other vital spot.”	 
>
> > **Spacecraft vs. Regular Creatures:**  
> > If a vehicle weapon system fires on an unprotected PC (or a PC in a spacecraft fires ship weapons on a creature outside the craft that isn’t colossal), it’s an entirely different situation. Attacks against a vehicle’s systems face all the previously mentioned modifiers. On top of that, add an additional five steps of hindrance to attacks by a regular creature against a starcraft. 
> > 
> > A PC defending from a spacecraft’s attack is hindered by five steps. Except in this case, the spacecraft inflicts damage. Given that ship weapons compared to handheld weapons are an order of magnitude apart when it comes to power, a good rule of thumb is that a spacecraft’s weapon inflicts 25 points of damage on a successful hit and knocks the character one step down the damage track. Even if the character succeeds on their defense roll, they still take 5 points of damage.
