## Optional Modern Fantasy Rules  

### Cantrips  
Cantrips are simple, low-powered spells that almost anyone can learn. In a modern fantasy setting, cantrips can be as ubiquitous and unremarkable as twenty-first-century technology. Instead of using the flashlight function of a smartphone, use a light cantrip. Instead of running a dishwasher or vacuum cleaner, use a cleaning cantrip. Instead of using a megaphone, use a voiceamplifying cantrip. 
Cantrips are generally not powerful enough to directly affect an unwilling creature or damage an unattended object. In the rare case that using a cantrip might cause actual harm, change, or damage, the attack roll for the cantrip is hindered by two steps (unless otherwise noted). 

Any PC can learn two cantrips by spending 2 XP. How they learn them depends on the setting they might need to study with a mentor, take a specific college class, pay for an informative ritual, study a magical book, invent it on their own, unlock some previously unrealized potential within themselves, and so on. Learning cantrips does not count toward character advancement. There is no limit to how many cantrips a PC can learn. In all other respects, cantrips work just like other character abilities. 

Unless the theme of the setting is that everyone is quite proficient in magic, it’s probably best to limit an individual NPC to knowing just a couple of cantrips, with many people not knowing any at all. A reasonable guideline is that an NPC can know a number of cantrips equal to their level.

#### Optional Rules: Learning Cantrips
In some fantasy settings, cantrips are commonly available, but not everyone knows how to cast them (in the same way that phone and computer apps are common, but not everyone knows how to code an app). When someone tries to learn a cantrip, have them attempt a level 3 Intellect-based task (skills such as magical lore affect this). If they succeed, they learn the cantrip. If they fail, they don’t. A PC only spends the 2 XP to learn cantrips when they succeed at this roll.  This way, learning a cantrip isn’t automatic—it’s more like passing a final exam. And there are ways for the character to “cram” for this test, including expending Effort, getting help, or using an appropriate asset.

### Covens
Magic is a community affair, and magicians are more powerful in groups. A coven is a group of three or more magicians with similar goals and values, supporting each other and working together to hone their craft. Forming or joining a coven grants characters additional abilities, which you gain separately from the standard advancement track. When you join a coven, you start at rank 1 within that coven, and over time can advance to rank 6. Rank is a measurement of your connection to the coven, and doesn’t necessarily correspond to your character tier—for example, a high-tier character might have a low rank in their coven. However, your coven rank cannot exceed your character tier. The primary magical benefit of joining a coven is gaining access to its spells: a set of character abilities that all members (of the required rank) can use. These spells are usually tailored to the coven’s interests and purpose, and are sorted by rank from 1 to 6. Because a character’s rank within a coven starts at 1 when they join, a new member of a coven has access to the coven’s rank 1 spell. When the character advances to rank 2, they immediately gain access to the coven’s rank 2 spell, and so on. You can think of covens as similar to flavors, in that they allow the GM and players to modify characters with abilities. Unlike choosing an ability from a flavor, a character doesn’t have to trade away or swap anything to choose or use a coven spell—they have access to these spells automatically according to their rank in the coven. For example, if the rank 1 spell for the Benevolent Bakers uses the Resist the Elements ability (handy for working over a hot stove all day), any character who joins the Benevolent Bakers automatically gains Resist the Elements, without having to spend extra XP to learn it or trade away a type ability for it. It’s possible for a character to belong to multiple covens, as long as the covens don’t have opposed goals. Characters advance their rank in each coven separately, so a particular character might be rank 1 in the Chronographers and rank 3 in the Foretellers. If a character leaves or is removed from their coven, they immediately lose access to all of that coven’s spells.

#### Joining A Coven
Joining an existing coven at rank 1 requires a vow and a ritual. Characters must commit to pursuing the coven’s goals and living in accordance with its values. The ritual is a demonstration of dedication to the coven’s purpose, and varies in difficulty accordingly. Characters receive their talisman once the ritual is complete. 

#### Coven Talismans
A coven talisman is a small item, such as a pendant or ring, that represents a character’s affiliation with the coven. Every coven member may carry a slightly different talisman, but they should be clearly related. The Benevolent Bakers’ talismans might include a necklace, a pin, and a keychain, all with the same whisk design. 

Coven talismans are a type of artifact, with a level equal to the character’s rank within the coven and a depletion of “—.” The talisman is what allows the character to use their coven abilities; if the talisman isn’t on the character’s person or within short range, all of the character’s coven magic is hindered by two steps. When a person advances within the coven, the talisman’s appearance may change to reflect this. While these talismans don’t require a depletion roll with each use, a character’s coven talisman automatically depletes if they break from the coven.

#### Advancing Within A Coven
Advancing within a coven is a separate matter from advancing a character. In fact, coven advancement is more similar to a long-term benefit of spending XP. Coven advancement should occur after a character has learned, discovered, or achieved something that aligns with the coven’s mission and values. 
To advance within the coven, the player spends 3 XP. Characters may mark the occasion with a celebration or let it pass quietly

#### Breaking From A Coven
If a character wishes to leave a coven, they relinquish their coven talisman and lose access to their coven abilities. But a character can also break from their coven by behaving in opposition to its values—such as if a Benevolent Baker were to knowingly poison someone. This causes their coven talisman to become depleted, meaning that they can no longer use their coven abilities. 

To restore their place in the coven, a disgraced character must begin by making amends with the other members. They then take their coven talisman to an epicenter and perform a ritual with a difficulty equal to their former coven rank. Upon completing the ritual, they regain that rank within the coven and can access spells accordingly.

#### Forming A New Coven
Creating a new coven simply requires a bit of discussion among the GM and players. Begin by deciding on the following: 
- What’s the coven called? 
- What are one or two goals for the coven’s magic? What do they want to learn how to do? What skill do the players want the coven to be known for? 
- What are a few succinct values? What do the players agree are the most important things a magician can be? Competent? Fair? Determined? Kind? Loyal? Wealthy?
- What does the coven talisman look like? 
- What does the initiation ritual (which exemplifies the coven’s goals and values) consist of? 

#### Selecting Coven Abilities
Coven abilities are chosen by the GM and players. To start, they need to decide the rank 1 ability. They can determine the rank 2 ability when at least one character is ready to advance within the coven. In a longer campaign, selecting abilities on an ongoing basis—rather than choosing them all at once—means that the players can choose their next coven ability based on what obstacles they expect their characters to face. 

The Cypher System Rulebook divides abilities by both category and power level, which is helpful in narrowing down your options. Choose a low-tier ability for ranks 1 and 2, a mid-tier ability for ranks 3 and 4, and a high-tier ability for ranks 5 and 6. 

Because covens form around unifying goals and principles, coven abilities should stack upon each other wherever possible. A coven of entomologists learning to summon and control leaf bugs might progress from Influence Swarm at rank 1 to Control Swarm at rank 2, Call Swarm at rank 3, and so on, eventually reaching Insect Eruption at rank 6. Don’t be afraid to be specific! Joining a coven gives characters the opportunity to become experts in a narrow field. 

If a pre-existing ability doesn’t capture what the players and GM are looking for, the GM is always free to create new ones. To return to the example of the Benevolent Bakers, no abilities in the Cypher System Rulebook specifically pertain to making food, but the bakers could modify an ability like Natural Crafter to suit their needs.
