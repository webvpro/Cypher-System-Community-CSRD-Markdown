# Type  
  
Character type is the core of your character. Your type helps determine your character’s place in the world and relationship with other people in the setting. It’s the noun of the sentence “I am an adjective noun who verbs.”  
  
>In some roleplaying games, your character type might be called your character class.    
  
You can choose from four character types: Warrior, Adept, Explorer, and Speaker. However, you may not want to use these generic names for them. This chapter offers a few more specific names for each type that might be more appropriate to various genres. You’ll find that names like “Warrior” or “Explorer” don’t always feel right, particularly in games set in modern times. As always, you’re free to do as you wish.    
>Your type is who your character is. You should use whatever name you want for your type, as long as it fits both your character and the setting.  
  
Since the type is the basis upon which your whole character is built, it’s important to consider how the type relates to the chosen setting. To help with this, types are actually general archetypes. A Warrior, for example, might be anyone from a knight in shining armor to a cop on the streets to a grizzled cybernetic veteran of a thousand futuristic wars.  
  
To further massage the four types for better use in various settings, different methods called flavors are presented in Flavor to help slightly tailor the types toward fantasy, science fiction, or other genres (or to address different character concepts).  
  
Finally, more fundamental options for further customization are provided at the end of this chapter.
