## Modern Rules Module
The modern setting is easy because it’s just the real world, right? Well, yes and no. It’s easy for players to understand the context of a modern setting. They know the default assumptions—cities, cars, cell phones, the internet, and so on. It’s also easier for some players to get into character, because their character could be someone they might very well pass on the street. It can be easier to wrap your mind around a history professor than a thousand-year-old elf wizard. These things make it easier on the GM as well. 
But for the same reason, it’s not easy. The setting is the real world we all know, so it’s easy to get facts wrong or let them bog you down. What happens when you pull the fire alarm on the thirty-fifth floor of a major hotel in a large city? How fast do the authorities arrive? In truth, the facts aren’t as important as the story you’re creating, but some verisimilitude is nice.
### Molding Characters for a Modern Game
If you’re trying to portray a psychic with a few basic powers, you might not want to use the Adept character type. Instead, choose a different type (perhaps a Speaker) and encourage foci such as [[Commands-Mental-Powers|Commands Mental Powers]] or [[Focuses-Mind-over-Matter|Focuses Mind over Matter]]. Some of the Adept’s powers might be too over the top for the genre.

Similarly, the technology flavor is probably too high-tech for a modern game. For someone with technical skills, use the skills and knowledge flavor instead.

Sometimes, the types might be more physical than is always desirable for a modern game, but that’s because the least physical type, the [[Adept]], is often inappropriate for other reasons. The [[Compendiums/CSRD/en/Descriptors/Calm|Calm]] descriptor is very good for such characters, not only granting them a great deal of skill and knowledge, but also reducing their physical capabilities.

Last, don’t forget foci such as [[Doesnt-Do-Much|Doesn't Do Much]] or [[Would-Rather-Be-Reading|Would Rather Be Reading]] for “normal” characters who have useful skills but not much in the way of flashy abilities.
