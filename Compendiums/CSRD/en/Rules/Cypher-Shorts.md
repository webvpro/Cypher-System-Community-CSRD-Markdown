# Cypher Shorts

Cypher Shorts are what we call quick and easy adventures for use with the Cypher System. The idea here is an adventure with very quick character creation and minimal GM prep, designed for a one-shot game that can be finished in a single session of three to four hours. If a typical campaign is an ongoing television series, think of a Cypher Short as a movie.

Cypher Shorts is a supplement for the Cypher System. You need the Cypher System Rulebook to play.

There are some key concepts to a Cypher Short that you’ll want to keep in mind if you’re playing, running, or creating one for yourself. They include:

>Very simple characters that are immediately involved in the situation. No long expository lead-ins, no “meet in a tavern” scenes.

>Characters have clear objectives, and there’s no thought to character advancement. This is a one-shot game, and we aren’t concerned about what came before or what comes after.

>There is less of a plot than there is a situation. Plot implies a linear direction: “This happens, then this, then this.” Cypher Shorts are meant to be framed more like: “You’re involved in this situation, so what do you do?”

>Just as players should use improvisation to react to and deal with situations they didn’t know were coming, the GM should be ready to do the same.

## Character Creation
Cypher Shorts use an abbreviated character creation system, even simpler than the standard Cypher System. This is to help players move quickly, without spending a lot of time deciding between this focus and that one.

The following character creation guidelines are very broad, designed to work with any genre or situation. In a specific Cypher Short, it’s likely that only the type choices will be detailed, using the information here as a starting point. Descriptors and foci are general enough that they’ll work with almost any scenario. Sometimes, though, a Cypher Short might require adjustments to suit the situation.

Just like in the standard system, characters end up with a sentence to describe themselves: “I am a [blank] [blank] who [blanks].” All players start with a score of 9 in their stat Pools, with 6 points to divide among them as they wish. They have an Edge of 1 in a stat of their choosing. Recovery rolls are 1d6 + 1, and characters have an Effort of 1. (Otherwise, don’t worry about tier.)
All characters start with 1 XP.

### Descriptors 
A descriptor quickly and easily distinguishes the character from the others. Ideally, no two players have the same descriptor.
#### Tough
>Add +3 to Might Pool. You are trained in Might defense rolls.
#### Quick 
>Add +3 to Speed Pool. You are trained in Speed defense rolls.
#### Smart  
>Add+3 to Intellect Pool. You are trained in Intellect defense rolls.
#### Skilled  
>Add +1 to Intellect Pool and choose three skills in which you are trained. These skills cannot be related to combat or interaction.
#### Charming 
>Add +2 to Intellect Pool. You are trained in persuasion and deception.
### Types
This is the role the character will have in the story. Types will likely change from genre
to genre, particularly the type names. So in this section, we’ll talk about them in terms of the general role the character will have in the story, not what players will write on their character sheet (although a few example suggestions are provided).
#### Performing Physical Actions
>This character might be called a Warrior, a Soldier, a Jock, or a Construction Worker (just to name a few), depending on the situation. Choose two of the following abilities:
>• Use any weapon without penalty
>• Wear armor without penalty
>• Stun an enemy as part of your attack, forcing them to lose their next action (costs 1 Might point)
>• Trained in two of the following: climbing, jumping, running, swimming • Add +2 to recovery rolls
#### Sneaking
>This character might be called a Thief, a Scout, a Street Rat, or a Slacker (just to name a few), depending on the situation. Choose two of the following abilities:
>• Trained in stealth and disguise
>• Trained in perception and deception
>• Trained in lockpicking and disabling alarms, traps, and other security devices
>• Add +2 to recovery rolls
#### Searching And Discovering 
>This character might be called an Explorer, a Detective, a Scientist, or a Middle Manager (just to name a few), depending on the situation. Choose two of the following abilities:
>• Trained in perception and Intellect defense rolls
>• Trained in Might and Speed defense rolls 
>• Trained in two of the following: climbing, jumping, running, swimming
>• Trained in knowledge-based skills (history, biology, geography, and so on) • Add +2 to recovery rolls
#### Talking
>This character might be called a Diplomat, a Priest, a Con Artist, or a Salesperson (just to name a few), depending on the situation. Choose two of the following abilities:
>• Trained in perception and deception
>• Trained in intimidation and interaction 
>• Distract someone, preventing them from acting for as long as you focus on them (costs 1 Intellect point) 
>• Add +2 to recovery rolls
#### Wielding Supernatural Powers 
>This type isn’t suited to all scenarios, obviously—it depends on the genre. This character might be called a Psychic, a Wizard, a Superhero, or a Mutant (just to name a few), depending on the situation. The player and GM will have to briefly work out the specifics together. Choose two of the following abilities:
>• Possess one offensive power (mental attacks, ray blasts, starting things on fire, and so on) that affects foes up to long range and either deals up to 4 points of damage or causes them to lose their next action. Costs 3 stat points (probably Intellect).
>• Possess one defensive power (force field, metal skin, super speed, and so on) that either grants you +3 Armor or eases defensive tasks.
>• Possess one miscellaneous power (moving things with your mind, flight, creating a duplicate of yourself, and so on). Costs 3 stat points (probably Intellect). You’ll have to come up with some reasonable parameters. You can choose this option twice.
>• Have two power shifts.
• Have another power shift.
### Focus
A focus determines the actions a character might often take in the story.
Fights: You’re a fighter. All of your attacks are eased, and you add +1 to your damage.
Plans: You think things through. You are trained in defense rolls, and you can choose two other noncombat skills in which you are trained.

#### Helps
>You help other characters. You can use an action to ease everyone else’s action if they’re within short range (costs 2 Intellect points). This can represent comforting, giving advice, or physically enabling them, depending on the character and the situation. You’re trained in first aid.
#### Provides Information
>You’re very knowledgeable. You are trained in three knowledge-based skills (history, biology, geography, and so on). You can ask the GM a question that has a pretty simple answer and get that answer (costs 3 Intellect points).
####Provides Comedy Relief  
>You’re funny. You can use an action to allow everyone to recover 2 points to their Pools in between each recovery action you take. You’re also trained in Speed defense and stealth.
#### Works With Tools (or Machines) 
>You’re trained in the use of two different skills involving tools and machines. You can modify an existing machine or device to do something other than its original function (costs 2 Intellect points).
#### Uses Powers 
>This focus won’t fit every genre. You can choose one of the abilities listed under the Wielding Supernatural Powers type. (Note: if that is already your type, you can’t select an ability you’ve already chosen, with the exception of miscellaneous powers.)
## The Scenario
When thinking about a Cypher Short scenario, think in terms of what you would expect to see in a movie. And not just any movie, but one where the action mostly takes place in one (probably large, hopefully interesting and dynamic) location
### Setup
This section of a Cypher Short is a brief overview of the setting and the premise of
the situation. The basic statement of the genre and setting should be given to the players before they make characters.
### Possible Encounters 
This section is a list of possible encounters that might happen in the scenario, depending on what the characters do, where they go, and so on. Cypher Shorts don’t rely on a keyed map or a detailed outline of a plot. Think of these as the possible scenes of your movie. More than likely, the group will have time for only five or six encounters in one session, so feel free to pick and choose the ones that best fit the way the game seems to be going.

>Each encounter is presented with a trigger, meaning that it is triggered by some action of the characters.

>Each encounter comes with the relevant game stats: the challenges for common tasks the PCs might attempt, the levels of NPCs involved, and other information not related to game stats, such as the answers to the questions the PCs might ask, the personality of any relevant NPC, and so on.

### Gm Intrusions
Each Cypher Short comes with a brief list of GM intrusion suggestions that are specific to that scenario.

Remember that GM intrusions are the only way for players to earn XP in the scenario, so they’re really important. At the same time, they will probably spend any XP they get. So there might be more calls for rerolls using XP in a Cypher Short adventure than you’re used to in a standard Cypher System game.
### The Conclusion
Ideally, as with a movie, the end of a Cypher Short session comes to a nice story conclusion (though not every ending needs to be a happy one). Hopefully, the main situation has been resolved one way or another, and the implications of what probably happens next for the characters and the setting are self-evident. But with a Cypher Short, we don’t worry too much about what happens next. It’s a one-shot scenario.
