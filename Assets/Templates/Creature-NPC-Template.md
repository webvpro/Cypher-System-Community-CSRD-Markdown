> **Environment: **   

>[!example] Modifications  
>- Sneaking, hiding, and attacking from surprise or advantage as level 7  
   
> [!example] Interactions  
> Running, at least from the malevolent ones, is typically the best course of action. Dealing with helpful black dogs is often an interesting and unexpected experience, as they don't talk and don't explain who they choose to help or why.  

>[!example] Uses  
>The characters are fighting an extremely tough foe when a black dog steps in to help them out (or to help their foe). The characters are lost in the woods, and a large, menacing black dog steps out of the forest and leads them back to safety.  

> [!example] Loot  
> Black dogs rarely have anything valuable on them. However, killing a black dog causes it to haunt whoever dealt it the fatal blow. That person feels such deep anxiety and despair that all their actions are hindered for at least one day, and often longer.  
 
>[!example]  GM Intrusion  
>The characters are fighting an extremely tough foe when a black dog steps in to help them out (or to help their foe). The characters are lost in the woods, and a large, menacing black dog steps out of the forest and leads them back to safety.  

>[!example] Combat   
> Malevolent black dogs will attack from a position of surprise or advantage, inflicting 8 points of damage with their spectral teeth and claws. Some black dogs cause such a deep feeling of despair and sadness, just by being nearby, that they inflict 2 points of Intellect damage each round on everyone who can see them or otherwise sense their presence.  
  

> [!example] **Intrusions: ** 
> The black dog howls, creating such a mournful sound that everyone in very long distance who can hear it takes 4 points of Intellect damage. A character who sees the black dog is deeply affected by sadness and moves one step down the damage track.
